\f0\fs24 \cf0 Now for some fun exercises! Go back in your timeline and write at least two 500 word newspaper articles, historical accounts (such as by a scholar), or some other similar piece of documentary writing about two different events that happened in your world's past. Then write two more articles about the same event, but from a different point of view, any different point of view. How would a writer for the Daily Prophet cover the Arab Spring? What would a person's diary entry from Tatooine look like at the height of the Rebellion, as opposed to someone on Coruscant? They don't have to be opposing points of view, just different enough for you to get a good contrast. }
