\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is one of those things that could either be a huge section or could be the length of a paragraph. Also one of those sections you might decide you want to go back to and enlarge, enhance, etc, later. Right now, all you need to do is go through your notes and write down one to three sentences of description in every location where a plant or an animal might be significant (say, if a particular store has seeds or seedlings for sale, or if a particular place sells pets or pet items too, or items for farm animals) and the same for every character who might have an animal or grow a plant in their home. If your society as you've built it so far is heavily dependent on work animals, expand that to a paragraph per animal or plant: what kind of uses do they have, both in general and specific to the character. How difficult is the upkeep. Etc. }
