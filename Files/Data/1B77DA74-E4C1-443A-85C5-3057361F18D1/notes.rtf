\f0\fs26 \cf0 Do the same thing with prejudices for, and put them after prejudices against in each category of bias. Remember that bias exists in positive or affirmative aspects as well as negative or derogatory. Also keep in mind that the aspect of a person, race, religion, or skill or profession that one group of people hates and derides might be the same aspect another group of people praises, or vice versa. Now we are focusing on the positive impressions, so keep it to the praises. If it gives you an idea for a bias against, go back and note it in the appropriate section.}
