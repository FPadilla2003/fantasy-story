\f0\fs24 \cf0 Write ten biographies of roughly 250-500 words of significant persons in your world, past or present. In this case, pretend you're writing a wiki article rather than writing from the point of view of someone who lives within the world because, depending on what literacy and technology level your world has in general, there might not be so many significant persons in the world and/or writing biographies might not necessarily be a Thing. Political figures, entertainers, scientists or magicians, people who were simply there on a day to catalyze an event. Serial killers. Revolutionaries. Innovators. Ten biographies, from various points in your world's history. Go! }
