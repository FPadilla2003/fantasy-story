\f0\fs24 \cf0 That sounds technical, but basically what it means is mapping out your locations in terms of what sorts of people live where. Where are your upper class people, where are your slums, and everything in between. If there are clusters of people from one cultural or racial group or another, etc. Sketch out, whether you use a mapping program or a pencil and blank sheet of paper, what goes where. Keep in mind the scope of your novel; if you're dealing with a planetary scale, you can be vague and generalize regions of the planet, making up a stereotype or two. If you're dealing with a city-wide scale, you might as well go into a little bit of detail. These details can come in handy later in dialogue or setting. }
