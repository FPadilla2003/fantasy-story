\f0\fs24 \cf0 Look at your normative life experience and tweak it. All life plans never come to fruition quite as one either expects or wants, but there are some obstacles that crop up that are predictable. Sudden poverty, for instance, sudden disability or sudden wealth. Take a look at the timeline for the normative experience for this world and pick five to ten points where a person's life might abruptly diverge from the norm. Write several paragraphs based on what you already have written (in that same manner) for each divergence, which also go into culture. }
