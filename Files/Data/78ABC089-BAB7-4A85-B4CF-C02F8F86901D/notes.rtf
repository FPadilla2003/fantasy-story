\f0\fs24 \cf0 Go through scene by scene, and since you're doing it anyway you might as well make your timeline. Highlight, bracket, or otherwise separate the scenes in your outline, day by day. Put, in a different color of text, the travel times between scenes. Then go back to the top of the outline and start again. Add a sentence or two next to the method of transition (bike, helicopter, wormhole) describing in very general terms the location the characters are coming from, and the locations they'll be passing through on the way to where they're going. Even if it's nothing more than a blue column of light. }
