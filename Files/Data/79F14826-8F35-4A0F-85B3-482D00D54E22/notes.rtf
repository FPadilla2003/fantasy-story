\f0\fs24 \cf0 Write five short pieces of fiction, dialogue heavy, from the following list: buying groceries, researching an unfamiliar topic at a library, making a large purchase (house or vehicle), enrolling in a class either academic or vocational, dealing with a crisis involving emergency services (this may include religious figures), revealing a secret to a/several friends or relatives, discussing plans for the future with a spouse(s) or lover(s), talking through a personal crisis of love or faith, courting a person, interviewing for auditioning or a job or apprenticeship or other similar position. These don't need to be from the point of view of a main character, it's just to give you an example of what a person in your world would talk like or do in any of these situations. The emphasis on dialogue is to keep it focused on the characters, but if you want to focus more on the setting (or use the setting as a character, which a number of well-crafted works of fiction have done) you can, too. }
