\f0\fs24 \cf0 Name the fuck out of everything. EVERYTHING. (This will probably also be a breather because not EVERYTHING needs to have a different name, you just need to decide whether or not it will.) Go through your outline and decide what this, that, or the other is named. Then go through your notes and decide what this, that, or the other is named. This will prevent you from going back later and flailing because you forgot that you had a city over there with no name and no way for people to refer to it in the story. Keep in mind that "the City" is perfectly acceptable, so long as in-text you make sure to have all your characters treat the same city in the same way, so that there is no ambiguity as to where your characters are referring to/going. }
