\f0\fs24 \cf0 That was potentially a long exercise, now we'll have a short one, and a fun one I hope. Descriptions! Start with the places and people you're working with in your outline and scribble down in the margins, on a sheet of scratch paper, or on a sticky note, one sentence of description for each of the five senses. As many of them as you can, at least, most characters aren't going to go around licking things. I hope. If you have time and inclination after that, go through and add these descriptions to other places, other characters. Add taste or smell or sound memories to the rites of passage and typical experiences you worked on earlier. Flesh out your world, make it vivid, not just in the organizational or grand details, but in the little things, too. What does it smell like? How do the buildings feel to the touch? }
