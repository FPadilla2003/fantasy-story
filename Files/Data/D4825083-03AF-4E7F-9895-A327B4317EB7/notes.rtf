\f0\fs24 \cf0 One for the visual learners! Make at least two pictures sketching out two everyday scenes in your world OR two establishing scenes in your work. Not action scenes or plot-heavy scenes, establishing scenes where you're setting out the most prominent characteristics of your protagonists, antagonists, or settings. Sketch, use photoshop, cut out magazine pictures and make a collage if you want to. Just do something visual, so you have that to go back and look at. You can do more than two, but at least do a couple. }
