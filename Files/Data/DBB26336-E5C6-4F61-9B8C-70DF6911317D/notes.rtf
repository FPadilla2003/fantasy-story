\f0\fs24 \cf0 This information goes on your character page. Possibly in its own section, depending on how prominent it is within your story. First list your character's role in the faction, then go through the data points you have on your character already. Connect them to your character's relationship with this faction. Remember that not all data points will have relevance to the character's relationship with or membership in the faction, just because a character is monogamous, for example, does not necessarily mean the League of Pog Collectors cares. }
