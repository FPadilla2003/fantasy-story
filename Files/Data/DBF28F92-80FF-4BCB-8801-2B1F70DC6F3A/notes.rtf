\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hey, look! It's your outline calling again! You've been working on characters, and you'll go back to them in a second, but first, get that scratch paper. Go over your outline and jot down every different location you have at which a scene takes place. Jot down how far apart these are, roughly, whether they're different locations in the same city or town or different towns in the same country or different planets. Different planes of existence. Go back to your character information and do the same. Group these locations by city, by borough if it's in one city, by country, by however many categories you need to. Write down a minimum five sentence paragraph describing each geographical location you will be working with. }
