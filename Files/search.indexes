            <Notes>As with government, this is something you'll have built the foundations of already with what you have in your notes so far. In this case you'll be looking at the cultures, the outline, and the demographics of your characters. The demographics will tell you the proportions of your characters, how many overall groups there are and how big they are in relation to each other. The outline will tell you how much detail you need to go into in order to give proper flesh and flavor to your work, and the cultures will tell you where your characters' priorities are, and what shapes them.</Notes>

            <Title>34 - Study your cultural biases</Title>
            <Notes>We have a lot of terms for the ways people interact with and treat each other. Familiar, impersonal, aloof. Racist, sexist, ageist, ableist, classist. Gay panic, transphobia, misogyny, white guilt, whether positive or negative there are a lot of terms for how we feel about each other as an individual about groups. Let me repeat that last part, as an individual about groups. Once you get to know a person on a one-on-one level it's harder to piece out what part of your reactions are to the individual and what part are to a group or classification to which that individual belongs.So. There are two places where the prejudices of your work's population will come into play. The first is in the outline. Go through it, looking at all the places where people interact. Look at the people interacting and put yourself in each character's shoes. Do they share a trait with the other people in the scene? How do they feel about traits they don't share? Are these feelings, either the in-group ones or the out-group ones, strong enough to affect how that character behaves? If so, is there a term in the society for this? Is this term shared throughout all parts of the societies touched on in the novel or are there other terms? Jot down at least five and at most twenty phrases, with a couple sentences of description, based on what you find in your outline. For example: . This will go under culture.Next, go through your character sheet and look at both the feelings your characters have about other people in their lives and their similarities and differences, and the feelings your characters have about other people's perceptions of them. The questions will be similar, but you might find one or two other terms you hadn't encountered before. Add in the ones you didn't find in your outline under culture.Finally, go back and jot down in your outline a one-sentence note for each encounter in which prejudice is a factor, just to remind yourself later. (And when you're hitting those blocks, you might be glad of that note, too!) Go back to your character sheets and summarize the attitudes your character gives out and receives, with a line or two added to each influence on your character's life, how this factored into it. Leave out the ones where it wasn't a discernible factor, of course. </Notes>

            <Title>47 - Historical accounts</Title>
            <Notes>Now for some fun exercises! Go back in your timeline and write at least two 500 word newspaper articles, historical accounts (such as by a scholar), or some other similar piece of documentary writing about two different events that happened in your world's past. Then write two more articles about the same event, but from a different point of view, any different point of view. How would a writer for the Daily Prophet cover the Arab Spring? What would a person's diary entry from Tatooine look like at the height of the Rebellion, as opposed to someone on Coruscant? They don't have to be opposing points of view, just different enough for you to get a good contrast. </Notes>

Also one of those sections you might decide you want to go back to and enlarge, enhance, etc, later. Right now, all you need to do is go through your notes and write down one to three sentences of description in every location where a plant or an animal might be significant (say, if a particular store has seeds or seedlings for sale, or if a particular place sells pets or pet items too, or items for farm animals) and the same for every character who might have an animal or grow a plant in their home. If your society as you've built it so far is heavily dependent on work animals, expand that to a paragraph per animal or plant: what kind of uses do they have, both in general and specific to the character. How difficult is the upkeep. Etc. </Notes>

            <Title>41 - Look at all of your characters, sort out and list their demographics</Title>
            <Notes>Take a look at all of your characters who have names or speaking parts and take a census of them. Have a look at Wikipedia or the census for your country (if your country takes a census) for ideas on how this is laid out. You might need a lot of scratch paper; the simplest way of doing this is to separate your characters into categories you want to take census of and make hatchmarks below each category for every character that falls under it. It seems like pointless statistic work, but it'll give you an overview of your world as you've created it, which is a good way of seeing if your statistics match the image of your world. For instance, if you picture your city streets as being full of orange people, with the occasional blue or pink person, and you realize that half your major or named characters are blue people, a lot of your single-line characters are blue people, and a lot of people in your orange characters' pasts are blue people, either you need to redo your demographics or your city has a peculiar enclave of blue people. Which implies all other kinds of things about diaspora, cultural centers, and migrant populations.If you're like me and you have a bizarre fetish for graphs, pie charts, and spreadsheets, you can even make this all prettified in a presentation. But that's not necessary.More seriously, this is a place where author biases can show up. Not because they're creeping in more here, author bias is a sneaky little bastard that's always around nibbling at your fingers. I mean, now that everything's crunched down to the numbers, this is where the numbers will reflect what you're doing underneath. Take a good look at your racial demographics, your sexual demographics, cultural, sexual orientation, species, social class, and wealth. Make sure that if you're focusing on one cultural group (Fiddler on the Roof, ), one gender (Oz, Shawshank Redemption, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie), etc, that there's a good reason for it. </Notes>

            <Notes>Check your outline. How much of this needs to be developed beyond one or two lines? The sad truth is, probably not much. But despite the attention to outlines, this still isn't novel writing, this is world writing. We're building a base for you to go on writing, or let your novel go in whatever direction it needs to. Check your outline, see what you have that you've developed, see what you don't have. Be aware of how much time you're spending on things you'll never put into your novel. Don't do any writing right now, just organize your thoughts, because after all that it'll be pretty chaotic. </Notes>

            <Text>Character-, location- or mood-establishing scene 01In one to three sentences, describe an aspect of the culture that appears in the scene or informs the character’s point-of-view.</Text>
            <Notes>
Everyone has culture. Everyone. No human being exists in a vacuum, and if a person lives with even a few other sentient beings, they have a culture. Monkeys, dolphins, and even whales have behaviours for both play and work that are taught from parent to offspring.The easiest place to start developing your culture here is from your outline. Go through and find the parts where you have to establish character, or the scenes where you have a location or mood to establish. If you don't have plot to move forward, you have a location or mood to establish. Creating some sort of culture or aspects of one gives depth to the world in which your characters move.On a piece of scratch paper, write one to three sentences for each character-establishing or location- or mood-establishing scene describing some point of the culture in which it takes place or that the point of view characters comes from. This can be episodic media entertainment (tv-series, radio series), single-unit media entertainment, literature, activities, art, architecture, historical re-enactments... anything non-subsistence and unique to that collection of people. You might not put in all of these as a descriptor, you might not even put in half of them. But if your character is casting an eye around a dark alley is he seeing posters for electronic music raves or old playbills for theatre shows? Is she likely to note the CDs on a person's shelves or that the decor of the home is incredibly retro? What kinds of games are people playing in the park? What parts of the body are taboo to show? This goes, unsurprisingly, under 'Culture'How you organize this section is up to you. You could organize it by arts and entertainment, businesses, sports and activites, or you could get more or less specific. Either way, you'll want to start out with some sub-categories in your culture section, and this is as good a place as any to do it. Sort each point of culture into a sub-category.

            <Notes>
How big of a story do you want to tell? Is it epic? Is it small? Are you crossing vast swaths of the land or are you confining three characters to a room and letting them endure each other for eternity? It's very, very easy to get lost in the process of building your personal playground if you don't give yourself boundaries at the start. Once you've determined the scope of the story you want to tell, you can establish boundaries: this far, and no farther. I'm taking it to the edges of the city. I'm taking it to the front door of the house. I'm gallivanting across the world.Determining your scope also helps you figure out the purpose of the story. Are you telling something deeply personal or are you taking your reader on a grand adventure? It helps you fill out some problems your character(s) might face along the way. A person confined to their house faces many different challenges than a person who's traipsing all over the wide world and back again. Again, we're working with the idea that worldbuilding is a tool that helps us tell a better story. This is a functional, goal-oriented approach. Flights of fancy are two doors down.Write a paragraph of up to seven sentences describing the scope of your story. Note both the general scope and exceptions where you might go outside it or spend some time focusing on one or two particular aspects. Put this paragraph in the forward-most section of your binder; this goes under summary information.

            <Title>11 - Describe your protagonist characters</Title>
            <Notes>
Unless your novel is very, very self-contained (think No Exit), you'll need to have certain information about your main characters. Take your original paragraph about your protagonists and copy it to the top of a fresh page. For each of these write a short 3-5 sentence paragraph: Technology/technological knowledge available, which can be anything from the simple machines to AIs and robotics. Economic/social class, what resources does the character have access to and what resources does the character go through on a regular basis? Magic abilities or mundane skillset, which may or may not be job related; what kinds of skills and abilities does the character use or think about on a regular basis? Culture and hobbies, what does the character do during off-hours? Classifications, whatever points of diversity you determined above. And finally, vital statistics. Height, weight and build, coloration and physical description, health, age.By the time you're done with each of these paragraphs, make a shorthand list for each category. One or two word summaries of the items in each category. Some of them you'll be able to cluster, depending on the characters involved, others will be more disparate. Either way, these are all areas you have now established as being in your world, genders, activities, skills, and resources. Put these in your characters section, and keep in mind that we'll be referring back to the lists and descriptions later.

            <Title>24 - Develop your factions in greater detail</Title>
            <Notes>
I put this section a little distance from the exercise where you create your factions, players, and sides, because I wanted you to get a bit of distance from it. Now we're going to go back to it and flesh it out a little more.Everything you write that involves more than two or three &quot;moving pieces,&quot; i.e. people or cohesive groups of people who want a thing and take steps towards that, your work will get a little more complicated. Two people in a work who each want something is a potential conflict. Three is a potential cyclical conflict, and four is a potential pooch-screw. And so on and so forth until you have political dramas where everyone is backstabbing everyone else and you need a chart with string in three dimensions to keep track of who's doing what to whom at what time.If you didn't flesh out your factions earlier, now is the time to do so. Expand each part, motivations and resources and membership qualifications and so on, till each one is at least two or three sentences in and of itself. If you did, pull out your outline and compare your faction list with what your outline looks like. Which groups will you be spending more time with? Which groups are just background players? More complicated, which groups appear only in the background of maybe two scenes but also perform actions that echo throughout the work? One author wrote a scene in the third book of his series where the main character lives through an event that comes back to bite him in the ass in books five, six, and seven, and that's just where I can think of the connection off the top of my head. Two characters who got maybe a line reference in that scene returned in book seven in a major way. It's much more helpful to plan things like that instead of trusting that later you can go back and insert them, or trusting that the story will spontaneously generate hidden shadowy figures of conspiracy as necessary.Make notes on your outline where your factions appear and their goals and influence is significant. If you have a chapter that's mostly a shopping trip designed for a bit of character background and for the character and her best friend to deal with a recent death of a third friend, probably your faction chart isn't going to figure into it. If you have a grand conclave wherein many parties are going to hammer out a treaty, you want to keep track of who's trying to move what pieces where. Again, all your faction notes go in &quot;Settings.&quot;Lastly, go through your character sheets and add in a sentence to a paragraph's worth of text, depending on the importance, of detail about any groups these characters might be involved in. Just so you have that information in the one place, too. Also review your character's relationship with the faction: is their membership obligatory because they were born to the Tudors or the Capulets? Does their membership in the League of Pog Collectors mean they can't have a monogamous relationship with someone of the same or opposite sex? Or, more likely, does no one in the LPC care? Or is the LPC a small group of five people in a restaurant somewhere and they only care because the group is so small that everyone knows everyone else's business?

            <Title>32 - Check your scope again</Title>
            <Notes>Check your scope again. Do you need to go further out? Further in? (We'll start with further in.) If you need to go further in, now is where you want to do it. You have a pretty good starting point for the world you're creating so far, now take a bit and read your notes and your outline. What areas seem a little thin? You can expand in all sorts of ways, you can put in more side characters, friends, co-workers, fellow hobbyists, fellow faction members, people who share one category or another with both your protagonists and antagonists. You can include more setting description, you can stretch out the travel time to either give your characters more introspection or more setting description or both.If you need to go further out, expand your scope, you'll need more character profiles. You'll need more locations, and you'll need a purpose for every extra detail you add. This will likely involve more poking at your outline than your world notes. If there are points you feel you need to make but haven't been, details in your world bible you want to flesh out but don't have room for in your outline, character aspects or dilemmas you want to explore more closely, or global ramifications to character actions. First, expand your outline. Then go through each section of your world bible so far, point for point, and expand your section accordingly. Geography, socio/economic data, factions, skillsets, etc.One thing I would be very careful about doing at this point, although it's not directly related to the process of world-building, is I would be very careful about adding another sub-plot to your outline. If you do that, you'll have to go back from the beginning and make sure all of these questions are answered for all the new locations and characters you'll be meeting, and it'll be labor intensive and possibly throw a lot of things out of whack. If you think you're going to do that, though, here would be a good place to do it. </Notes>

In your geography section, beneath each location, write down a sentence or two saying how this location can be accessed.

Synopsis.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Barge, an unregulated Altreyan inn, bustled with uneasy energy. A locale for the filth of the city. The sort for cutthroats and corruption. The guards ignored it any way they could. No one wanted to affect the flow of gold if it flowed into their pockets. And so it did, as a woman sitting on a barstool, focusing on a cold pitcher of ale, twirled a gold coin around her fingers. Clockwork. When she finally heard the back door open, a rusted creak muffled within the racket, she pressed the coin down onto the hardwood countertop with her thumb, sliding it to the other edge where the innkeeper wiped down kegs.
“You leaving?” he said in heaving efforts.
Turning around, she spotted the man she knew as Niko nervously palming one of his Kurasei sticks. Hair down to the veins in his neck, donning black garbs with a clipped cape, the man shifted through the crowd, navigating through the tight spaces in between tables. Tables filled with gatherings, booze, illegal card games. She wasn’t impressed at the image of him. “Yeah. I’ll be back tomorrow.”
“Alright, sweetheart. I’ll be here, as usual.”
She hopped off the stool, moving her gilded hand to her back, where a knife hid inside a horizontal sheath connected to her belt. As Niko arrived at the exit of the inn, the woman was on his trail, hovering her hand over the sheathed weapon. Niko twisted the door open, sinking down the steps onto the crowd below. Outside’s dark orange glow illuminated the place. Night would soon fall.
She never forgot the day it was. The 5th of Wern. A popular time for Altreyans. The streets clogged up with folk buying goods at the local markets, trinkets and the sorts, she almost lost him in the thick of it all. Trotting down the stairs behind him, she noticed he was headed west— towards the outskirts. She also noticed a small detail: two extra weapons were attached to his weapons belt. Knives. Like hers. She shook off the confusing thought and kept going. He occasionally paused to view wares, even buying a simple object, and the woman hid within plain sight, eyeing these magnetic steel orbs at an adjacent market stall. She thought that buying some conceal her cover more, …. She would be paid for this ordeal anyway. Passing a quick couple of coins to the seller, she peered over at where Niko was, but—
(something distracts her and he leaves) He was gone. Panicked, she scanned the faces in the crowd. The black garbs were nowhere to be seen. All she spotted was green, brown, gray. The cool colors of the city. Nevertheless, she knew she would find him. Heading towards the outskirts as before, her once steady gait picked up, stashing the metallic orbs in her pockets. She scanned more faces. All the ordinary. However, it was her lucky day as the street sloped down with a gentle decline, the apex of the road a vantage point towards the ends of the city. Cobbled rowhouses lined the sides of the street, purple-fire lanterns hanging from the outer walls. Far in her sight, the archway that led to the strange outside of the city stood rugged against the outer wilds of the Wyth Forest.
And right there, as she peered over the people, she found the black-garbed man, turning right into an alleyway. Sprinting to her found target, she weaved through the masses like a needle through silk. Every step graceful. Every movement calculated, except… when a laughing woman, unaware of the bolting assassin, took a step backwards at the wrong moment. They both collided, sprawling onto the ground. A metallic screech. The assassin, shaking with anger, wiped away at her bloody cut lip, her tooth an inch away from chipping. She watched the other woman begin to cry, her dress dripping with the drink she held moments before as two others helped her up. A tall man, red-headed, offered a hand to the assassin. She took it, hoisting herself up, and before he had a chance to apologize for his drunk friend, she pushed him out the way, staggering across the street to the dark alleyway a few blocks ahead.
Silence. Compared to the bustling roads, this alley was nice. However, the space felt tight. Claustrophobic. Her breathing quickened as it seemed there would be no easy escape, and Niko faced her, holding the twin sticks of the Kurasei in each gloved hand. He was right where she wanted him though… isolated and vulnerable.
A cold breath fogged in the air. “Who are you?” he spoke. “Why are you following me?”
No talking. Get this thing over with. She reached for the knife at her back. A subtle gesture. Air replaced where the handle should have been. What? Fidgeting with the empty sheath, her already nervous breath turned into a panic.
“You don’t talk? Fine.” Niko smashed the two ends of his weapon together, a quick spark bathing the alley with blue light. The two sticks morphed into a quarterstaff, the middle glowing with the cool color as both sticks mended. He tightened his grip on the staff, the weapon diagonal across his body, shoulders level and feet planted onto the packed dirt below. “Run now. Don’t make do this.” She screamed, a high-pitched battle cry ringing out, dashing right towards the man. He sighed, readying his stance for an Oberhau. “That’s not what I meant.”
As she sprinted, she looked for anything of use in the area. The walls that crowded them were too far away to use as a platform to jump from. She was too far away herself to use the dirt in the road to cloud his vision. No. She needed something. Anything. He could not live for much longer. She wouldn’t allow it. But right then, she remembered the metallic orbs she had bought from the stall. She had no choice. Without a second thought, she removed the orbs from her pockets while in her all-out sprint, throwing one of them against his adjacent wall. As he flinched, his vision ripped from concentration, the other orb flew through the air, whizzing by the quarterstaff and striking him in the face. Recoiling, he held the cut skin with his hand. She kicked his leg out, his stance faltering, elbowing him across the jaw, and climbed over the bulk of his body, a quick hand pulling out one of the knives from his belt. Before she could grab the other one, though, he rammed into her, swinging the quarterstaff around, slamming it into her abdomen and throwing her across the alley. She caught herself, stopping the momentum with her right foot, crouching down with the knife in her hand. Dead eyes stalking her imminent prey.
Muttering, he stared at his already bloody hand, “By the Gods.” Her breath raspy, she had to admit— the hit to the stomach knocked the wind out of her, her eyes bulging as she recuperated her breath. “This will not end well for you. Run away while you still can. You seem young and talented.”
“You’re the one hurt, not me,” she forced the words over her weighted panting.
He shook his head, unclipping his cape, the garment drifting to the dried soil. “You are stubborn, aren’t you? Well then. I’m sorry for this.” The man readied his stance one final time.
Her vision was unfocused… shaky. Like paused moments in time, the man charged at her still crouched body. She could barely process it. Why can’t I see him well? What did he hit me with? She rummaged around the ground, finding one of the orbs she had thrown at him. With a hefty try, the orb flew again through the air, only to be deflected by the quarterstaff, the blow smashing the item inside of the wall, specks of dust puffing out. She suspected another Oberhau was readied to end her. It could not end like this, against the wicked magic she had been fighting. As a last ditch attempt, she forced herself up, the handle of the knife feeling familiar in her worn-down palms. The man did not stop. She would not stop either. She waited for him, readying the knife for a slice at the neck. However, she could not focus on anything, as if she had too many drinks at the bar. A sick nausea infected her stomach. No. Not like this. She screamed, thrusting the knife into the place she thought the man was at. She was wrong. Niko, with the quickness of a fox, disarmed the woman and hovered the staff over her head, her vision clear from the sudden adrenaline. He was inches away from ending her. But… he didn’t. The weapon hovered over her nevertheless.
“Give up, now.” His poise was relentless. “It’s over. I don’t want to kill you.”
Those words were enough. Her body lethargic, she fell to her knees, the knife scattered on the ground. “What… did you do to me? I feel nothing.”
He sighed again, breaking the staff into two. “Your life essence is pure. I felt it. Your body is not used to my touch. To the touch of the manipulated Spirit.”
Winded, she could not stare at the man. It was too shameful. She would rather stare aimless at the ground. Fishing her mind for any thoughts, her ambition did not engulf her as much as his sorcery. “That’s why… I’m here,” she whispered. “That’s why I’m here. Against your bloody magic.”
“What the—” he took a few steps back, watching the defeated woman speak to him those words. “You were there,” he jumbled his thoughts together, stumbling his words. “You were there when I was with Hathes.”
“Who’s… Hathes?” Her eyelids drooped, sensing their utter weightiness. 
“No,” he rattled off. “Who the hell are you? How do you know what I said?”
“I… I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
His mind ran rampant. “Dammit. I can’t be here. I need to leave.” 
Stashing the Kurasei sticks inside the belt loops, he sauntered away, the woman still on the beaten ground. Her hand trembled, seeing the blurred image of the knife in front of her. She reached out, grasping the handle of the knife, clenching it with all her might. She had to wake herself up. She had to, before he was too far away from her. She could not find him again this easily, as he was aware of her existence now and had seen her face. This was supposed to be a quick job, another man cut from the hidden shadows of the Spirit hunters. 
She slapped herself across the face. “Wake up.” She slapped herself again. “Wake… up.” Another. She was desperate, more than ever. The hunger of Spirit rose, even without knowledge of the sacred art. A subtle light blue filled her veins. Not enough to notice… but enough to care. She slapped herself once more, the anger turning into a rage, almost wild-like. “Wake… UP!” Her knuckles bulged from the tightness of her grip. A last, heaved effort. She threw the knife at his direction, the weapon spinning through the wind, almost cutting right through the air. All of the force she had left attached to that damn knife. All her dreams and goals manifested at the end of a sharpened blade. Niko stopped, sniffing the air, his face twisting, as if a burning stench permeated his nose. He whispered in realization, “Fortification…”
He turned around, smelling the sudden burning of the woman’s Spirit, never before touched. But before he could react, the thrown knife buried itself deep inside his ribs, inserting itself all the way inside his body. He staggered, holding himself up against the wall. He stared down at the blood oozing from the edges as he realized what had happened. “You… stabbed me. I…” The man knelt down, the pain from his ribcage pulsating, the area numb and warm. (stick with woman’s pov)
As for her, while she was on the verge of fainting, it didn’t matter. As she watched the man struggle, facing the sudden shock of defeat, an instinctual chuckle came out of her mouth, morphing into quiet laughter. That smile on her face, almost radiant as if she had won a price. “I won… He’s done.” The blue from her veins faded, returning seemingly normal. 
The Spirit hunter toppled over, hands flat on the ground, gloved fingers splayed. Each twitching. Droplets of blood stained the dry ground red, dripping from the wound. He panted, hair slick with sweat, eyes agape and dulled with ire. Pulling out the knife from his side, the blade thudding, the blood droplets fell faster, pooling the ground with his life essence, almost dark in coloration.
Even without her knife, that smile radiated a sense of satisfaction. Her deed done. Her father would be proud. After a year of bringing these men to justice, this one felt especially gratifying. Not that the kill itself satisfied her, but the man behind it did. But this one… this one was different.
His quickened breaths alerted her. Almost foaming at the mouth, Niko growled, bloodshot veins protruding from his sclera. Fingers burying themselves deep in the dirt, his frame quivered, backbone arched. He tilted his head upwards, eyeing the woman down. His eyes and veins around his face began to beam that recognizable blue light, teeth so clenched that his jaw could fold into itself. She gazed in utter horror as the blood droplets seized to fall, and the man, in a quadrupedal form, ripped huge patches of dirt out from the ground where his fingers resided as he launched himself, sprinting on all fours like a rabid animal. By the time she could process it all, it was too late. He pounced, gliding through the air, slipping the twin knife out from its sheath, and tackled her, the ground shaking from the impact. With no hesitation, her eyes scrambled from fear, the man pinned her down and stabbed her in rapid succession. The blade pierced her torso again and again, blood spurting from the flurry of gashes. All. Pure. Rage.
The pain was excruciating. Brutal. Unspeakable. There, she writhed her body around, screaming to all the Gods for the pain to stop. And in this dark alley, as the sun took its slumber for the night, a fading, dying light, no one would hear her scream. The savagery was brutal. Too much to handle for any eighteen year old. Niko’s hand, after a while of its rampant and random behavior, stabbed at the ground as all the anger began to seep away, tears welling up in the man’s glowing eyes. The blade stained with her life essence, the pure Spirit was tainted. The blue light dwindled from his eyes and veins. The stabbing motion became more controlled, slowing his flagrant movements, as the knife eventually slipped from his hand, catching itself through the bloody tip of the blade. A drop of blood trickled down from the cross-guard, seeming to disappear once dropping into that stained pool of carnage. Her breath shallow. Raspy again. Wheezing through punctured lungs.
His muscles relaxed. The tears, which had accumulated enough liquid to trail down his face, must have tasted like salt-edged seas, mixed with the sour taste of her blood that spattered across the alley. His lip trembling, staring at the mess of his hands, he removed his black gloves. Ancient, aged hands, as if they were not his own, were hidden under the fabrics of those gloves— wrinkled and frail, bone jutting out from the skin, which was dotted with dark spots. A guttural hiss emerged from her mouth, her lips twitching as if to say words which could not be formed. Or it could have come straight from her lungs. Her breathing was doomed to fail, anyway, so why should it matter? Nothing really mattered for her. But for him…
“No…,” a silent cry left him. “No. No. No, no, no.” He grabbed her body, placing her head on his lap with grace. The woman stared at him, still alive. Any second now, and she would… her eyes began to close. “No, stay with me.” He was desperate. With the blood on the ground, he trailed his index finger on top of it, staining his digit. “Come on. Come on. You can’t die.” He drew a symbol, a simple script known to most Spirit hunters, on top of her forehead, the motions almost foreign to him. Drawn with vile disgust. Blood was never his thing. With that, he took in all the air he could find, drawing in a deep breath, focusing on the power inside him. He repeated the meaning of the script over and over again in the vacuum of his mind. “I’m sorry.” Tears could not be controlled. They poured out of his waiting eyes, his face still and collected in irony. They ran nevertheless in anticipation.
The script, in all its glory, glowed bright blue, the light illuminating his face. Like a lantern. He laughed, almost maniacal, although he was still choked up, knowing that even through the rustiness of his skills, he was competent enough to use the Bestowal method. And with that, a shock to his body began at his heart. This feeling was all too familiar. Through the thin layers of his skin, little wisps of blue Spirit crawled out, bobbing through the air with a sort of gentleness. The center of each one wrapped onto itself, reflecting pure, crystal light, like spindle fibers. They were beautiful and benign. That was what life was supposed to represent, before humanity ripped away at itself like gnawing pests. That was the Gods’ only intention— pure beauty. 
The wisps of Spirit, before the woman could stop breathing for good, were absorbed by the script on her forehead, her almost-closed eyelids pulsating with light flutters. Everything began to mend: the open wounds and gashes through the brown fabrics that she wore closed, wisps knitting them tight before hiding inside her body again; the pale skin and bags around her eyes that shifted into a more vivid radiance; and her hair and nails that had been newly repaired, brighter and rich with elegance. After a few minutes, at peace with his ability and the woman’s calm breathing, he smudged the blood script with his palm, erasing their connection. Spirit, which had been lost in the air, now returned back to him, feeling a part of his life coming back. What he had left, of course. He pulled back his sleeve— the aging crawled all the way up to his elbow. Sighing, he carried her, her fainted body still. His face distorted, he muttered to her, “Why did you do this? You were too young. Too young. I’m sorry.”
A grinding of dirt under leather boots. A young guard, mustache sculpted to the common city style, appeared at the dark alley, swaying sideways a chained purple-fire lantern. The shadows, and what was in between them, showed everything he needed. An indistinguishable, running figure had turned left at the end, probably behind the rows of houses. “Hello? What is this?” He studied the scene. A cape in a bundled mess laid in front of him. He picked it up, peering at the clip that adorned it— a crescent moon. “A Salatharian?” he questioned. But the guard, in a sudden rush, eyed what was in front of that cape and dropped it. Dried blood marked over the walls and ground, with two individual knifes encrusted with it. Running away to the main street, pulling out a small bell from his pocket, he rung it. The others would come shortly.
In the spaces where shadow engulfed the light, a lone, metallic orb hid. The trinkets of the 5th of Wern. What a joke.

Yes, this is an important part of worldbuilding, too.The nature of your characters plus the scope of your story will determine how much of your world you'll need to build for background purposes. If you're not forcing your characters to interact all over the world, but rather only in their own home town/home territory, you'll have less geographical area to cover. And on the other hand, think about how much of the world we live in affects how we think, talk, dress, act, and react. Your character's thoughts and responses, actions and questions, will be affected by the world in which your character grows up. In either case, you'll be spending roughly an equivalent amount of words describing either several different locations and cultures from an outsider perspective, or describing one location and culture from an in-depth and insider perspective.You don't need to answer everything in exhaustive detail, but you do need to figure out some basic things. We'll get to the details later.Again under 'summary information' (Scrivener alternative – in the Characters folder), write a paragraph of up to seven sentences detailing your protagonist(s). This will also give you an idea of how cluttered your cast may or may not be. Just go off the cuff, list the most striking features of your protagonist, whether that's physical appearance, grace, intelligence, background, a personal possession, a pet, or a relationship/set of relationships. Keep in mind that all those will need to be developed later. It's also okay to say &quot;I have not yet decided A or B.&quot; You'll have to circle or otherwise choose one later, but it's okay for right now to have some options open.

            <Text>The disfigurement of time had warped the young man’s mind. He had to remember— just in case. Watching in the deep darkness, seeking vision in the most diminutive crack from his perception, his mind played out a bright morning along the Road of Rednin, where a piece of parchment hammered onto a post flapped against the current of the wind. Focusing further, the blurry parchment, clearing up around the edges, was a poster. A missing poster. And under the scrambled portrait of a man, a name was written at the bottom: Tristan Bellinger. The man of the hour.
Tristan thought of himself as a failed bard. In the midst of his fame, he had turned to other professions. Other passions. However, this one would never fade from his life. It would never die. He plucked the strings of the lute with delicacy, each note drifting into the bedroom. His children watched him in amusement from their separate beds, mesmerized at the man who plucked away at his art. Their wide-eyed expressions would have seemed excessive for anyone looking in, but in this particular city, where noble boys were known to either study Spirit tomes or train as a knight, their father was the one legend who had become the utter exception to the rule. The rule that any young boy could do anything, and that the glorious days of prestige did not only exist at the tip of a sword. For them, it existed at the frets of a lute.
By the time his calloused fingers were tired, he stood from the chair against the back wall. One of the boys groaned, Tristan laying the instrument flat on the seat. “Father, one more, please!” the kid on the left yelled dissatisfied, eyes still glued to Tristan as if he held the instrument. This boy, named Som, was the younger of the two, always rambunctious and loud. He was similar to his father in that way.
“I can’t. You both have practice with Lady Metris tomorrow. Did you lot forget?”
Som groaned again, twisting his face in disappointment. The other boy laid in his own cot under linen blankets, quiet and absent-minded. He emitted a subtle smile, as if dreaming about performing in front of an Altreyan crowd, gold coins flying in his direction. 
“Aw,” Som’s voice went quiet. “You can’t afford one more?”
Tristan sighed, shifting his gaze to his other son. He never expected for them to love the lute as much as he did, but night meant sleep, and his eyes were already a bit swollen from a lack of it. “What do you think, Leon? Should I do another one?” The quiet boy didn’t respond, almost delirious in his daydreams. Tristan chuckled, moving over to the candles around the room, which he blew out with a faint puff. “That’s what I thought. Now go to sleep, boys.”
The younger boy fumbled with the blanket in a fit, the folds stuck in between his feet. With an exasperated pull, he hid his head under the covers, his voice muffled, “You always listen to Leon.”
 The last candle was blown out, smoke trails crowding the ceiling, and the only light left in the quarters was the hazy beam of the moon. So Tristan sauntered by, passing through the moonlight, its rays casting light upon motes of dust, and stopped in front of Leon’s cot, his gaze unaware as a whooping cough cracked the silence. 
Tristan’s face twisted. “My boy,” he settled his hand on top of his son’s forehead. Leon flinched. “Are you okay?”
He gulped, staring up at him. “Yes, Father. I’m sorry.” Another cough rung from him. Leon waited there in thought as he cleared his throat of phlegm. This boy was similar to Tristan in that way— always lost in his thoughts. Each of them naturally inherited something from him. After all, they were his children. “I can’t wait to be a bard like you someday.”
The prime worry of his son’s health melting away and his mind on the lute now, Tristan chuckled again, a smile radiating from his weary face. His boys always did that to him. “I know you will be better than me. Altreya needs good bards to show them what they lack. You’ll be one of them, right?” 
The boy nodded. 
“Well, you will have all of your dreams tonight to practice.” 
Tristan felt his own thought whoosh by. The man scratched the scruff of his beard, muttering to himself, “Hm, I’ll be busy for a while though.” After a second of contemplation, he focused back on his child. “How about I show you a new chord or two in a couple of days, aye?”
“Really?”
“Yes, really. Your mother should come tomorrow to take care of you. She knows you’re sick. When I come back, I’ll let you play around with it.”
Most children around his age would jump in excitement at such a remark, but not this peculiar one. The boy reached out, holding his father’s hand with a feeble touch. “Thank you,” he whispered. Tristan reciprocated the gesture by tightening his grip on Leon’s hand in tiny pulses. He lifted the blanket up to the boy’s chin and headed to his other son.
Som remained hidden in the comfort of the sheets. Tristan crossed his arms, clearing his throat. “Take the blanket off your face. I want to wish you a well night.” The boy did not respond. Tristan pinched the edge of the blanket and pulled it away.
“No!” Som failed to grab the sheets, now exposed, curling up into a tight ball that made his short, brown locks poke out.
“Come on. Are you really going to be upset at everything that doesn’t go your way?”
The boy muffled, his voice almost silent. “You don’t understand.”
Tristan really didn’t, as his children were given everything they wanted… and more. It was never enough. After waiting, the man gave up. “Fine.” He dropped the blanket onto the bed, but the child did not dare to move. His pride wouldn’t allow him. The father, in his own dismissive behavior, stopped at the ledged door, his footsteps strident, scratching his forehead as if a thought could not leave him. 
Releasing it into the air, he responded, “What has your mother fed into your head, huh? I know I’m not perfect… but fix your attitude or I won’t play you music ever again.”
Silence.
“You hear me?” Tristan did not turn around to repeat his sentiment.
Silence again. He understood the message.
Another sigh. “Sleep, boys. You don’t want to upset Lady Metris. I’ll see you tomorrow.” And with that, Tristan headed out of their quarters, performing his normal night routine. The door bolt sliding to the right, he wrapped the lock in a rugged chain, an iron padlock linking both ends together. Since the boys could not sleep well under purple-fire lanterns, he had begun to lock their doors as a precaution against the wilds where the Scourges slept. He planned, like he did every day, to wake up before them, when the sun had started to peak over the horizon, and unlock it. The Bellingers were never too safe, he always told himself.
He began extinguishing the hearth, pouring a hanging bucket of water across the ashes. The candles were all blown out, his breath waning after every subsequent one. He paced to the window, rain droplets catching on its surface, which faced the main street of the city, and blew out the last candle, the only light except for the moon fading out of existence. It was only then when he noticed something strange— a wretched blue script stuck to the glass. Behind the blood inscription, a dark figure loomed, gazing right through the window to where Tristan stood. 
His appearance drained of color, a pale, ghost-white washing over his visage. He peered at the figure, observing it further. It couldn’t possibly be staring at him… right? But no, the figure’s intent could be sensed through the window, to the moonlit face of the Bellinger. On top of the shadowy silhouette, crooked sticks protruded out, and dotted on its face, or where its face should be, glowed more of those bright Spirit hunter scripts. He gulped, a million thoughts racing through his head. Checking his children’s door, it was locked as before. He didn’t need to worry about them. But a slight reminder, a memory actually, echoed through the theater of his mind. From his other passions. His interest group had spoken about the myth of the Spirit hunter who stalked prey in the night, waiting for any opportunity to strike at them. The crooked sticks… like the antlers of an elk. Any bard believed the stories they were told. Right then, his neck pulsating from the deep thumps in his veins, he knew who this figure was. Who was stalking him. His name was Elkskull.
His legs stiffened. Stepping backwards, his gaze fixated on the haunting figure, afraid it would disappear before his eyes, leaving his family all in danger. If he looked away, they all would—
 He bumped into a stack of books on the ground. The Spirit tomes tumbled. They crashed on top of one another. He peered at them, which detailed the importance of keeping Spirit pure. He wasn’t prepared for something like this. The silhouette of Elkskull, white dots replacing where the eyes should be, waited patiently. His own patience faltering. There had to be something.
He didn’t want to give up a bard’s duty back then. It wasn’t his fault. As the natural interests of the city changed, he had to adapt. The pouch of gold he received every day felt lighter… and lighter. Inns had been overrun by, most of all, Spirit hunters, and their services dwindled in the eyes of the rebelling public. He had to change. So… he did. His mind finally focused on a singular thought. An undying one. He hadn’t used a sword in a while. His idea needed one. It wasn’t wise to dawdle around when the monster was so close to his children. He had to face it straight on, as if his life depended on it. And the stories about his glory… it was time his life needed one.
With a quick bolt, the pressure of the stalker getting to him, he threw open a rusted coffer and inspected the dull, tarnished blade of a familiar shortsword and its scabbard. Latching it onto his side, he felt younger already. Though his father was a failed warrior, he knew he wouldn’t be. Great stories of glory never ended with failure. With the lineage sword at his hip, he swung the door open against the blasting gales of a thunderstorm, pulling the sword out, shaky at his grasp, and spilled out onto the front of the rowhouse. Nothing. His eyes widened up, body drenched in the rain. Elkskull was gone. He looked around, frantic in his motions. Mud glued itself onto his boots as he struggled through the mushy dirt. No footsteps could be found either except for his own. Before his panic rose to an unreachable height, he found clues apparent on the dirt. More glowing blue scripts. And, like paw prints, they dotted their way to the archway that signaled the end of the city and the start of the forest wilds. They glowed with unseen intensity.
As if bard’s greed infected his mind with gold, he trudged through the mire of the street, almost running. He couldn’t afford any failure in this journey, including losing track of Elkskull. If the myth was true, and the enigma knew where he lived, they would have been dead by sunrise. He arrived at the large archway. The portcullis lowered, its spikes were sunken under piles of sludge. He rapped at the stone walls in desperation, yelling for the crew of the gatehouse. “Guards! Guards! Open the gate! Open the damn gates!”
A gatekeeper stuck his head out of a slit, spotting the man with his sodden noble garbs. “What the hell are you doing up, sir? Head back home! It’s pouring!”
He banged the wall one last time with the pommel of the sword, staring up with vindictive eyes. “My name… is Tristan Bellinger! Husband of Hayra Bellinger, daughter of the Spirit Lord! Open the gates now! I demand you! Please…!” 
God. What am I doing?
The gatekeeper headed inside. The use of his title washed a feint discomfort on him, but it must have worked as the portcullis now rose, iron creaking from rust. The city of Altreya opening to the cruel world. Out of ignorance, he flailed his sword around while he ran, passing right through the archway and towards the mountainside Wyth Forest. Blue scripts guided him further, deviating his path from the Road of Rednin into the woods.
He sprinted until his legs buckled. The flora of the forest dense and almost impenetrable, bushes and high trees surrounded him, its thick, gnarled bark standing like watchful guardians. He tripped, his torso crunching down on dead, dry leaves. He grabbed the dry pieces, examining his wet clothing in return. Curious. In fact, he stared up to where he expected revengeful clouds and instead saw a thick leaf canopy. Drops of rain thudded against the canopy’s surface but none fell inside. Strange. And in the rush of finding the infamous Elkskull, he did not realize how dark it had become. How lonesome. No wonder the travelers who got lost here had bestowed it the moniker the “Shadowlands.” Only shadows accompanied him.
Standing up, he noticed the path of scripts, which shone in the darkness, ended. The last one on the forest floor was even more potent. His knuckles ashen white on the sword, he pivoted, one step at a time, and scanned the woodlands where only rays of moonlight could illuminate his way. Where could this Elkskull be? Did he follow the wrong path?
“Hello?” Tristan yelped. 
His footwork sporadic. His eyes darting back and forth into an abyss he wasn’t prepared for. 
“Hello?!”
One hand gripped the other, clutching the handle.
What was this? 
He yelled again into the lone air. “Come fight me now! Don’t be a coward! You… you brought me all the way out here, huh? What do you want with me?!” His cries turned desperate. His tone shrill. “Please. Listen to me. I’m only a humble bard. I don’t know what you want with me. I didn’t even know you existed!” He began doubting himself. He wasn’t a warrior. He was a bard who disgraced his art by heading towards dangerous work instead of doing the thing he loved. The conservation movement of Spirit got to him. His life wasn’t fulfilling. It never was with his newfound position. No. He was happier with a lute in his hands, singing away, ale and gold flying and drowning him in glory. Why did he not drown in it? Why?
Did the threat even exist? Did he really follow a false path, possibly made by rebel Spirit hunters practicing their forbidden art at the start of the night? Maybe he imagined it all. The stress. The work. The money. The children. Was it all getting to his head? The sword trembling in his grasp, right when he almost convinced himself of his own spurted lies, he heard something drop behind him. Whirling around, the nape of the neck aware of every tiny sensation, a branch had collided onto the brush. It wasn’t the myth. A smirk. He must have gone crazy in the delirium of his thoughts. Exhaling pure life essence in relief, his grip loosening on his father’s sword, he fell silent, watching the dark vignette of the world closing in. In the corner of his vision, however, like a flash of an eye, a silver sword, clean as mirror glass, emerged from the right. It glinted in the one ray of moonlight. The sword, level with Tristan’s neck, wasted no time. It graced his jugular vein with the slightest pressure. All that could be heard was—
Slice.
Tristan thudded wayside, sprawling on the ground, clamping down on his neck where blood gushed out. Like a rain gutter. He cried, blood spurting onto his clothes and palms. A bubbling sensation crawled up his throat, an iron taste inundating his mouth. He felt the life drain out of him. Unable to breath as his lungs rejected the air, he peered up at what would be his last memory. Elkskull loomed. No wonder they called him that name. He wore the skull of an elk over his head, and speckled on the ivory-bone were blue scripts, which glowed with the most intensity Tristan had ever seen. He towered over the fallen man. His suit, made from an amalgamation of individual leaves, rustled in the crying wind.
Elkskull sauntered over the soon carcass, every step crunching down on brittle foliage. The silver sword dripping with the remnants of the father. Silent. Unbothered. The sign of a true reaper of death. He peered right into the eyes of Tristan, which remained paused in fear. The man could not move. He could only feel his eyes blinking slower and slower.
Watching the tremors of his prey, Elkskull knelt down, pulling out a glass vial from his side. “Tristan,” he shushed him, easing him flat to the surface with a gentle push. He could only oblige. The Bellinger could see the leaf canopy as if it was the sky. Elkskull removed the man’s hand from the wound, blood streaming out, witnessing the wide gash at his neck. “It’s painful. I know. Don’t worry. It’s over now. You can sleep.”
One last thought infected Tristan’s mind. He couldn’t help it. “Leon…”
“Is that your son?” he leaned the glass vial against his neck, filling it up with the life essence of man. “I’m sorry…” The skull of the enigma tilted down. “My father died too when I was young. But I would not worry. I’m sure they will thrive without you.” 
Spirit was running out. It seeped into the soil. His blood would be the foundation of new life— weeds and flowers could grow here. Tangle the forest with their very being, weaving into the environment as a whole, for an elk to stumble upon and eat, which his children would in turn feast upon in their noble lives. At least he could leave a part of him with them, even if it was a single drop of blood. (maybe change blood with spirit?) And then, after a final breath which mimicked the breeze of the woodland, he fell silent. Unbothered. Tristan Bellinger was no more.
(too quick of a transition)
The sun rose from its slumber. It poked above the horizon, its rays filling up the world with almost holy light. A young man, holding an elk skull in one hand, walked along the outskirts of the Wyth Forest, reaching the Road of Rednin. His almost white but blond locks short on his scalp, he sighed and marched forwards. He knew that he would find the missing poster shortly, for he had seen in his mind. Deep in his collected, twisted mind, where time manipulated and almost tortured him, Aley had seen the death of Tristan Bellinger.

“Tristan,” he shushed him, his neck gashed open. “It’s painful. I know. Don’t worry. It’s over now. You can sleep.”

“Leon…”

“Is that your son? I’m sorry… My father died too when I was young. But I would not worry. I’m sure they will thrive without you.”


Starts with Elkskull bringing someone to the forest, luring them with glowing blue scripts. That person he’s luring is a big dude in the Spirit conservation movement.

We'll look at two things when we're determining this: your character's economic background and your outline.Start scene by scene, and if you're doing this on a grand scale, start only in one city or small country. We'll get to the rest later. On a fresh piece of scratch paper, look at each scene or act or block of outline that takes place in that city or country and jot down two to three sentences about the economic aspect of the setting. Is it an opulent, rich setting? Poor, depressed neighbourhood? Somewhere in between? What does it have in terms of resources and what is it lacking? Are people managing a subsistence living or is there a surplus, or is the focus on luxury at the expense of actual stability? That will give you some idea of how varied your work will be and, obviously, how much you'll have to expand your world and your background.Go to Part 2 of this step.

            <Text>“You’re free to go,” he grumbled. Inhaling pure smoke from an elongated pipe in between his lips, the scent of rootweeds and cherries permeated the room. Niko fidgeted with a small artifact— a handmade necklace, beads covering the wire that held an obsidian gem in place. His black locks hung over forlorn eyes. He was used to this.
With no hesitation, he pushed the chair back, heading to the bolted door. Picking up a quarterstaff propped up against the back wall, he snapped the weapon in half, a subtle blue spark coming from the middle. Crafted from lignum vitae, the separate two sticks, known throughout the nation as Kurasei, were inserted into fitted belt loops at his hips.
“Wait,” the man voiced out. Niko stopped, his hand gripping the door handle. The graveled voice echoed throughout the chamber. “Don’t forget what you owe me, Spirit hunter. You’re not in Salathar anymore. Remember that.”
Niko tightened his grip. “I will do well to remember it, yes.” He opened the door, a slight creak piercing through the silence. “And you will do well to remember that I’m not a Spirit Hunter anymore. That’s why I’m here.” A sigh. A vision of wildfires, his babe clutching at his chest, his wife beside him. “That’s why I’m here, Hathes.”
Footsteps faded away into the hallway.
Another puff of smoke seeped from Hathes’ mouth. He reached at a white feather, dipping it into a pool of ink. “My dear servant,” he mumbled, writings dotted by ash. “You are still one to me.” The bearded man wrote away, parchment filled with dreaded words. Signed at the bottom: Moonlight. Spirit. Revival.</Text>

            <Title>42 - Work the linguistics</Title>
            <Notes>Now that you've got your maps, your demographics, and some history and idea of the places, skills, and activities you'll be dealing with, it's time to approach an area that could be overwhelmingly vast or dismissively small. Linguistics!Not the science of linguistics but the application of language to the context of your work. At its simplest, this might mean you have a small division between characters who speak with complex phrases and multisyllabic words more often than not, who don't say 'um' or pause or repeat themselves when they speak, and characters who say 'ain't' and 'um' and 'might be.' If that's all you're doing, I suggest you at least take a look at the works of Elmore Leonard, or listen to Robert Downey Jr speak. Look at authors who are known for their dialogue, and listen to speakers who have vivid manners of speaking. Paying attention to their habits will help you polish your dialogue so that it sounds more natural and thus more vivid within your story. Your prose, descriptions and actions, will come out in your own voice, and that's as it should be.If, on the other hand, you're creating whole new worlds, fantasy worlds or new planets and spacefaring races, you might be at the more complicated end of the spectrum with creating a constructed language, or 'conlang.' And there are pages and pages and pamphlets and websites on creating a conlang, though I don't have one to recommend immediately to hand. I'm not going to recreate them here, I'm just going to suggest that this is a good time to take what you have and use it to build a conlang, if you feel the need.Somewhere in between is the world of dialect and jargon. Jargon gives the flavor of authenticity to your work, but it must be used sparingly so that your broader audience knows what you're talking about and for the love of Twain use it correctly. Ask a specialist in the field in which you're writing if you're not sure. Dialect will make your work vivid, as I said, but it helps to have the right dialect in the right place. Elmore Leonard, Joss Whedon, (and others) are all good examples of writing dialect. They know how people speak and they know how to re-create it so that it feels real to the audience. Ian McShane, Robert Downey Jr, (and others) are also good examples, more on the acting and delivery side.Look at your outline and your character sheets. Your character sheets will give you some idea of which characters might have distinct speech patterns from the others; think of characters who are from a different place or a different time than most, or think of characters for whom you want to highlight a particular aspect like class or heritage. Your outline will give you some idea of where it's appropriate. Consider that you probably speak more formally or at least more politely at your job, or if you're talking to an official person, than if you're relaxing with your friends. Finally, once you've figured out what your characters' dialects should reflect and where you're going to put them, it helps to make a dialect sheet. It's not hard; a dialect sheet is basically a list of bullet points: quirks of language such as having no articles (Russian) or repeating a word for emphasis (most pidgin dialects), and phrases you might substitute for commonly known phrases that either have fallen out of use or that you've made up entirely.One last thing to consider as you're finding places in your outline where dialect and jargon goes is, again, clarity. Will writing all chapters that are from the steerage boy's point of view in a lower class, East End type of dialect help sell the story, or will it confuse the audience? It takes some practice to find the balance between the two. Handing it off to a first reader or three helps. </Notes>

Common personality traitsShared personality traits of a species are usually generalisations. Personality traits could develop as result of environmental factors or through genetics. If your species is separated into distinct groups geographically, this may result in clans or tribes having different personality traits depending on experience, interaction with local ecosystems and other environmental influences.Physical characteristicsThis characteristic is often best visualised through graphic art but not all writers can draw. The written physical description you provide for your species should include the shared characteristics between all clans or tribes no matter the location. If your species is subject to a varied physical form depending on genetics or environmental factors, you may want to create a list of the different physical attributes and the reasons. Consider including a traditional dress or ceremonial dress as part of the physical description.SubspeciesClans and tribes are usually differentiated by location. Each location will have different environmental factors that could trigger inter-racial differences: physical, emotional and intelligent. Consider how your clans and tribes communicate, have there been any racial customs that may have been adopted by other clans of the same species through marriage, trade relations or invasion? What are the cultural or physical differences between each clan or tribe?AlignmentThe alignment characteristic has its origins in role-play games. It helps to define the general demeanour of a species as good, bad or indifferent. Looking at the history of your species and its accomplishments can help to determine its general alignment.Relations &amp; allegiances with other speciesHow does the species view and interact with, other species. What relationships do they have with other sentient or sapient lifeforms? How has this effected their society?Social customsWhat social customs do they have?HomelandWhat does their homeland look like? What are its characteristics? If you species has migrated across your fantasy world, consider showing the origins of your species on your world map. You may want to include the path(s) of migration as well as the current civilisations.ReligionWhat are the core beliefs and values of your species? Are there divisions in your species based on religion or is the racial culture unified in its belief on origin and spirituality? Does your species worship a single Deity? Religion can have a large effect on social relations, technological advancement and social values and norms, as well as shared personality traits.LanguagesIf your species is the only sentient or sapient species upon your fantasy world and it is divided into clans or tribes in different geographic regions it may have quite a diverse linguistic culture. In fantasy settings and especially in role-play games a common language shared by multiple species who co-exist together is a common characteristic. Each species may still has its own language and characters are often able to speak more than one language depending on their experience.Common First NamesIf you have constructed a Conlang for your species, you might draw common first names and surnames from its dictionary especially names that pertain to fauna and flora which could be adopted for characters. Your species religion(s) can also provide a source for first names as too can the history of your fantasy world. Popular first names may change over the course of time. Using a first name in a repetitive fashion for characters of a certain generation would mirror the use of first names in our own human culture however, it may make the story harder to convey and your readers might get confused.Common Family NamesThe origin of family names in our own societies are often derived from a position or role that a family may have within a community. The surname &quot;Wells&quot; for instance is thought to have been provided to families who were well diggers by trade. Surnames are not necessarily required in small populations but as a population grows it may become a requirement so that people can be told part. Sometimes a surname may also originate from the description of where a person hailed from, for instance, Alex Von Appleston might have been used to describe Alex who came from the small hamlet name Appleston.AdventuresHow adventurous are your species? Do they like to travel to find battles to fight or do thy prefer to learn new experiences? Are there religious pilgrimages that your species embarks upon or quests for the youth to take in order to enter the world as an adult?Physical attributesIf your story or geofiction contains combat or use of physical strength then it is important to keep a note of your species's limitations. How fast can they move / run? How high can they jump? How much weight can they lift? You may want to include two sets of figures, one for averages and the other for extreme abilities.Favoured OccupationsList the particular occupations that your species may be suited to holding within your fantasy world's society. Why is the species suited to perform the tasks associated with the position? Are there physical, mental or spiritual attributes of your species that are ideally suited to an occupation? Are the choices for the favoured occupations based on social interactions and hierarchies with other species?Level of AdvancementA species could advance to become a super species only if the physical, spiritual and mental capabilities of your species allow it. A species without magical powers may find it difficult to advance in experience or better themselves if the world around them required the use of magical abilities. The degree of racial intelligence are also factors limiting advancement.CivilisationsWhat civilisations is your species responsible for nurturing or helping to build up? What part did the species play in the civilisations creation, growth and demise? Are there any significant cultural advances that your species has helped to create?Magical/special abilitiesNot all specials will have magical/special abilities. These abilities do not have to be magical/supernatural in origin, but may be the result of scientific intervention or breeding. These abilities may have a positive or negative effect on a species. It can build them up to become powerful both politically and physically or it can cause them to become outcast. Keep a detailed list of the abilities of your species if you decide to include them. Does everyone inherit the same special abilities or are only a selection of powers inherited through genes? Do the number or strength of special abilities increase or decrease with experience and age? You might choose to restrict abilities to people who are in a certain profession or who worship a particular deity.Famous personsAre there any notable famous people in your species? Famous characters could be heroes or heroines of ages past or they could be influential people from the present time period, such as a politicians, magicians, teachers or bards. Famous characters don't have to be the characters that you are pivotal to your story, but their actions may have had a lasting influence on your species and its development.Population statisticsInclude the population statistics on your map for your fantasy species. The size of the population and ability to socially network with other species can influence the diversity of the culture and sub-cultures of your species.HistoryThe history of your species may begin prior to the your fantasy world if the species has migrated from another world or it may have begun many billions of years after your world came into existence. When you first begin fleshing out this section of your template, jotting ideas down in bullet points is good start. You can later develop these ideas as part of your world building or story.</Text>

            <Title>16 -  Develop your skillsets</Title>
            <Notes>
Go back to your character sheets for each character, and get out a couple more sheets of scratch paper. Starting with the first character that comes to mind or hand and continuing through, write down each skillset, i.e. each hobby or occupation, volunteer position or vocation. One to three word identifiers will do. Right now all you're doing is making a list of the activities and jobs that feature in your work.Next to each skillset, or in some way that links to the skillset name, write down five or six skills that a person in that position would be expected to have. A writer would have advanced knowledge (one hopes!) of spelling and grammar in at least one language. He or she might also have typing skills, research skills or organization skills. Don't laugh, writers, it's true. A priest might have counseling training, knowledge of religious rituals of his or her particular religion, perhaps some history, and certainly would be literate if not well-read. A pilot of a small transport ship would need to be skilled in mathematics and astrocartography and have practiced reflexes. And so on and so forth. If you don't know what skills are required in one job or another, ask! One of the miracles of this thing called the internet is that you ca be in communication with many, many more people than you would otherwise.Keep in mind that a single character might have several skillsets, depending on what they do for a living and how many hats they wear in their daily life.In each character page, underneath the character information you have so far, write down a three to five sentence paragraph per skillset that that character possesses. Ultimately you might have five or six paragraphs describing the skills your character possesses, and now keep in mind that other people in this world will have these skills as well. If you find yourself in abrupt need of fleshing out another character you'd only given a moment's thought to, you might want to go back to these paragraphs and see that you had a fishing boat captain who played for Irish dancers in her spare time, so this other musician might have these skills but also those of that racing jockey over there. Mix and match!

            <Notes>
And back to the outline again. Remember when I said this was going to be a functional approach geared towards writing a story? I meant it.Look at each scene of your outline. By this point if you only have sections or acts, you should pencil in a rough scene progression. For each scene, write down the overall activity taking place, one or two sentences should do it. Now go back to your character pages. Take a look at the skillset required, and go back to your outline and add a sentence or two (or more if you need it) describing in more detail what these characters would be doing. It's a little complicated, so here's an example: Say you have a scene in which a musician is rehearsing for a concert later on in the novel. Your scene notes might look like this.// Sascha and the gang rehearse for Horrorfest.In which case you would go back to your skillset grouping and check the related skills, then go back to the outline and add a couple sentences.// Sascha and the gang rehearse for Horrorfest. Sascha is doing a sound check while Steve tunes up his bass. Jules has the set list in front of him and is making some tweaks.Because we often write what we know, what appeals to us, a lot of this will involve going over information we already know. However, again, you might find you're writing a science fiction novel about robots and what you know about robotics would fit on a thimble. This helps guide your research so that you don't get sidetracked and fleshes out your novel at the same time.

            <Title>37 - Develop places for your characters' youth and childhood</Title>
            <Notes>Back to location-based world-building! Back to your maps! Go through your characters' youth and childhood, the typical experiences, and start marking down the places they've been on your map. Even if it's just a dot with a flag. Do the same for the normative templates. Then give each location at least three to five sentence paragraph under the 'Settings' section. Before you were writing about neighborhoods, now you're writing about individual buildings, school houses or malls or stadiums or day cares.Keep in mind that all of these places have contexts as well. Are these neighborhoods, towns, or even planets nice places to grow up in? Is life hard for children, or are there plenty of families and safety networks to help them out? If you're working with places you've already started to flesh out, you might know this. If you're working with an entirely new section of geography, look at the character and how they grew up and use that as a jumping off point to think about what these places might have been like. Think about who the people who worked there were like. You can even, if you get inspired, write a couple paragraphs about them with the same format as you have for your tertiary characters, your bit parts. World-building in this way is a bit like terraforming (or at least how I imagine terraforming to be, since we can't quite do that yet.) Once you lay down your basic components, all kinds of unexpected things start growing. </Notes>

All life plans never come to fruition quite as one either expects or wants, but there are some obstacles that crop up that are predictable. Sudden poverty, for instance, sudden disability or sudden wealth. Take a look at the timeline for the normative experience for this world and pick five to ten points where a person's life might abruptly diverge from the norm. Write several paragraphs based on what you already have written (in that same manner) for each divergence, which also go into culture. </Notes>

            <Notes>On a separate piece of scratch paper, jot down two or three sentences about the economic background of every character who appears or lives in that city or country. I mean every character. Even the ones you didn't give a name who barely have one or two lines, like Charlie Brown's Teacher or the Cheese on the Head man. Now go over all these sentences. In your binder under 'Resources' (Scrivener alternative – The World -&gt; Resources -&gt; Economic background) start a new sheet of paper, this time from the least amount of economic resources and going up. Start with a header of 'Least Resources' and either copy over or clarify (you may find that having to rewrite your notes a couple of times gives you ideas or clarifies your thoughts) all your notes from your scenes and your characters. You can, if you know you'll want to come back to it, highlight the times when your main character's name appears, so it catches your attention. Then go to the next highest, which might be 'Lower Class' or it might be 'Working Class' or it might be another, less politically-loaded term. If you know you want to give your world its own vocabulary, now would be a good time to start; there's always some kind of set of words to describe who has Stuff and who doesn't.By the end of all of this you should have roughly a paragraph each describing the economic strata you'll be running into in this city or country. Each paragraph should be at the top of its own page (we'll get to why later). Some of it you'll be visiting in the description of the scene you're working on, and some of it will be in the form of assumptions your characters make. Maybe they're used to everyone having a vehicle or mode of non-ambulatory transportation. Maybe they're used to getting medical care when they need it. Maybe they don't take having enough food for granted, but your character's background will shape how they think about and react to what you're throwing at them. It might even help add a scene or two to your work.</Notes>

            <Title>39 - Develop your world timeline</Title>
            <Notes>Develop your timeline. By now you've got a lot of events, an outline, and a lot of character history. Use your character history and your outline and your world bible so far to develop a timeline of your world. Use the start of your novel as your zero hour and expand both forwards and backwards, starting with the events you've already set down. How fast is technology developing? How are social attitudes changing? Go back and forth between this timeline and your character information, making adjustments as you need to. This part goes in Setting, because the history also makes a part of the setting.Keep in mind that sometimes things can change very, very fast. There are people living now in a country where legal racial equality is assumed (though not necessarily fact) who have grandparents who were assumed to be slaves. There are people living now in a country where individual thought and exchanges of ideas are everybody's privilege who grew up in that same country where conformity was demanded. The majority of the population living today grew up before the internet and thus information (true or false) became commonplace, before exchanges of ideas became easier for many, many people (but not everyone).Keep in mind also that some things change very, very slowly. Look at the Catholic church. Look at Judaic practices. Look at the idea that things and people that are different from us are dangerous and subversive and should be squashed, that idea hasn't changed much in recorded history. </Notes>

            <Notes>
No, seriously. Outline your story.Because this is a functional approach, you need to have an idea of where your story is going so that you have an idea of what you need to develop. You really don't want to go off into a 20 page tangent about sewer systems in one city because you got distracted with the mapmaking program one day and by god you're going to put those sewer maps to use. At a minimum, divide your story into acts (nine acts in groups of three for epic stories, three acts with an intro and coda for mysteries, googling will help you find basic formulae for most kinds off stories). Write one to three sentences for a scene-by-scene outline, two paragraphs for an act by act outline. We'll come back and develop the outline itself later, and in the meantime we'll use it as a basis to develop the rest of the world. I mean it. You will be referring back to your outline every step of the way.For now, we'll go back up to the character sections (2 and 3) and cross-check that with your outline. Do you have enough characters to fill the story? Do you have some extraneous characters? On a piece of scrap paper or in the margins of your outline, make a note of every time a new character appears in your novel. Then make sure that character is represented in your protagonists or your antagonists section.Some characters won't be main characters. They might barely even be speaking roles. That's fine, for now just write their names or designations (Teacher, Bartender, Random Passer-By) under either the protagonist or antagonist column or, if they're filler or background scenery, make a third category for that. All you need to know now is that they exist. What your expanded cast looks like, which will already tell you how populated your world will be. There, you've learned something new about your world already!

These don't need to be from the point of view of a main character, it's just to give you an example of what a person in your world would talk like or do in any of these situations. The emphasis on dialogue is to keep it focused on the characters, but if you want to focus more on the setting (or use the setting as a character, which a number of well-crafted works of fiction have done) you can, too. </Notes>

            <Notes>
There's an old idea that the core plot of most works can be narrowed down to person vs person, person vs outside world, or person vs self. It's true. At the very least, it's true that the core conflict in a story can usually be boiled down to A vs B.Write down your A vs B at the top of a page. This is your focus of your novel, your core conflict, what drives the action and the plot. Han, Luke, and Leia vs the Empire. The Fellowship of the Ring vs Sauron and his minions. Malcolm Reynolds vs everyone else in the gorram universe. Now go down the page and write down some basic questions, and you already have the who and the what, hopefully, but if you haven't, write that down as well. If it's character vs an outside force, what is the outside force? When: Is this story taking place over a few days or over several years? How is the conflict manifested, subtly in many smaller conflicts or blatantly? Where do the conflicts manifest? And if your scope is small, this will be a very easy question. If your scope is larger, you'll need to describe some locales, cities, towns, countrysides. A sentence or two will do for each.At the bottom of the page, write a paragraph of up to seven sentences describing the why. Why is this conflict happening? What brought these things into conflict? Is it contrariness, is it an aspect of the protagonist character that forces conflict, is the protagonist seeking it out or did conflict drag the protagonist out of bed kicking and screaming? This all will go into summary information.

            <Title>23 - Check your scope. Is it as big as you thought? As small? Adjust</Title>
            <Notes>
While you're looking at the scope of your work, check it. Is it as big as you thought? As small? Are you discovering you have a bigger story to tell than you thought, or are you sticking only to a handful of characters because you've bred way too many plotbunnies and drawn way too many plotlines? Adjust. This is also a good place to finish or pad out your outline. No, seriously. It helps. You might have discovered that issues have come up that you want to deal with, so this would be a good time to work in those little scenes or line references to deal with them. Issues such as plot holes, lack of motivations, too many potential motivations, or visible character development.(Note: visible character development is different from behind the scenes character development. Once you get some practice in, usually character development is one of those things that makes itself known, if you know them well enough. But it's always a good idea to go back and check to make sure that what your readers see is clear and follows about as logically as sentient beings get, one action from the next.)

Synopsis.</Synopsis>
            <Text>More often than not, there was a greater elegance in the pursuit of death than the purpose of life. The leaf canopy shielded the forest from blue moonlight, little rays shining through the gaps. A sudden wind passed through, like a whistle tone. The blades of rootweeds fluttered in the gust. Amongst the foliage, a lone elk sauntered. Silent. Unbothered. Life essence exhaling through its breath, it bent at a flower and nipped at it.
A slight rasp of metal. Blinding glints of blue shimmering from the edges of a silver sword. His steps untraceable, the light-footed boy stood at the ready, his eyes on the target. Like his father taught him… left foot forwards, right foot backwards. To any normal pair of eyes, this would have seemed like a normal animal. But to him, the elk glowed, a spiritual radiance gleaming off the creature’s fur.
A flash of the eye, and the elk tumbled, thudding wayside. Green painted with streaks of red. Silent. Unbothered. The sword dripped with the remnants of the creature, and he heaved a great sigh, the pressure of the hunt lifted from his shoulders. The boy, a fair-haired one, pressed his hands onto the soft fur and caressed it. The animal whined in pain, unable to move. A single teardrop remained stuck on the animal’s eyelid.
“I know,” the boy whispered, shushing the soon carcass. “It’s over now.” He removed a small glass vial from his satchel. The spiritual aura of the elk still wained, pulsating like a beating heart. Shushing the animal, he collected the still-dripping blood from the neck wound, the liquid bright with a light-blue shimmer. After stoppering it, he gazed in amusement at his blood-stained hands and the power of the vial at his fingertips. He finally did it… all by himself.
However, the sounds of the forest alerted him. Low-vibration hums shook the trunks of trees, swishing his hair a bit. He knew he wasn’t alone then, so he acted quickly. As an act of mercy, he chopped the elk’s head off and brought it with him, the aura finally dissipating from the corpse. He scurried off into the darkness of the forest.
Fren waited for his son at the outskirts. A burly man, he sat on the remains of a rotting tree trunk. He checked the position of the sky-bearing moon, filling up most of the night at its apex, and he noticed it had started its eventual descent over the horizon.
Come on. Come back.
The worst part of it all— the silence. The true horrors of the forest were hidden deep in its heart, away from the strolling passersby at the trails that snaked it. Animals with any proper amounts of spiritual energy lived as prey for those horrors, and the forest was only one of the locations that housed them. Though, if his son could not survive the forest, how could he survive the rest of the world? No, his return was necessary.
After a fleeting thought of death, something brushed his cheek. Alerted, he peered at the dark opening of the forest. That was when a bright smile appeared across his face. Blue wisps like floating embers of a dancing fire blew in his direction, following the path of the wind. Another wisp brushed him, his fingers grabbing onto one alone in the air. What followed them was his son, emerging from the shadows surrounded by a swarm of wisps, carrying the head of an elk. 
“I did it, Father! I did it!” he swung around his trophy.
“Yes, you did, my son. Calm down, now. You don’t want to damage the skull.” The boy stopped. Fren took the head away from him, watching its glassy eyes. The spot where a teardrop soaked into the fur. “I have to make sure. Did you harvest the blood?”
“Yes, Father.” He pulled out the flask from his satchel, the liquid still intact.
Fren placed the elk’s head down, inspecting the flask next, careful not to drop it. It was perfect. That was all they needed. “Aley… good boy. You did fantastic. An amazing job.” (make it like he did it)
“Really?”
“Yes, really. Did you make sure no Scourges followed you back here?”
“Yes, I was really careful. I even tried the footwork you taught me.”
“Alright, alright. I believe you.” He tousled the boy’s fine hair, loose like silk threads. “Come on. Let’s go home and eat. We have much celebrating to do.”
They marched back towards the city of Altreya, their hometown. However, something that was known to all but rarely spoken was that Spirit use was forbidden and taboo there. But Fren, as a veteran Spirit hunter, could not help himself to the powers that laid within each aura, and his son could only observe as things unraveled. Time cursed the ones who tried to play the role of the Archaic Gods— even he knew as much.</Text>

            <Notes>Do the same for your antagonist characters. Consider that antagonists usually have slightly different skillsets than protagonists, because of different factors, different interests. Consider also that antagonists aren't always (aren't mostly, even) polar opposites in most day to day matters. The antagonist is the person who is working counter to your protagonist, your main character, setting up the conflict that drives the plot. They might not be evil. They might not even be overtly malicious. In fact, if you can forget that these are the antagonist characters, it might be better to do so. You're creating vivid, well-rounded characters, and which position they occupy in the conflict is not the focus of this exercise.</Notes>

            <Notes>
This may seem complicated, but it really isn't. Go back to your outline. Look at all the scenes or, if you don't have it scene-by-scene yet, all of the acts, or the general progression. Write down five items of technology you will need for each section, whether it's a Simple Machine or a cell phone or even something in the background that may never be referred to in the text itself. Knowing it's there will help set the scene for you. You can duplicate items if a character's cell phone, chemical camera, or Antykitherian device becomes a plot point, as long as you have those items of technology for each section.Overall, this should give you an idea of how technologically advanced and oriented your society is. Some societies place more of an emphasis on technology than others. And, looking back at your scope description, you might go through a couple different attitudes. Your item list should reflect that.There are a number of ways to rate the level of technology available to and pervasive within a society, and you can pick one of those if you like. You can also just have a general idea how advanced your society is from the items you've chosen. However you do it, write at least two paragraphs describing the level of technology in your world. Write at least five if your scope is vast. No more than 1 1/2 pages of material, but you should have a sufficient description of how advanced technology is that someone reading it over can have an idea of what your world looks like in that way. File this in a separate section of your binder or under a separate word document, Resources.

DescriptionHistory(Everyone comes from somewhere.  People just don’t up and appear on islands and such.  I mean, even Native Americans walked across a land bridge way back in the day. Europeans came from Romans and Greeks and Celts and Gauls and more.  Very few people bother to look at this aspect of world-building, and they really should.  Even if a civilization has been around for two thousand years and are elven dragon riders, they came from somewhere.  Even if their mythology says they crawled out of the earth: they came from somewhere.  Examine it!)</Text>

            <Title>Planetary classifications</Title>
            <Text>Planetary classificationsClass A, B and C Typically small, young planets whose class depends on their age and solidity of their cores.Class D Class D objects are planetoids like asteroids and some moons. Regula, the site of the underground second stage of the Genesis experiment in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, is a Class D planetoid. The USS Voyager also encountered Class D planets in the Delta Quadrant, one in the Star Trek: Voyager episode &quot;Gravity&quot; and one in the episode &quot;Emanations&quot;.Class E, F and G Typically, Proto-Earth-sized planets whose class depends on their age and solidity of their cores.Class H Class H planets appear in the series as harsh desert worlds. The planet Tau Cygna V visited by the USS Enterprise-D in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode &quot;The Ensigns of Command&quot; was designated as a Class H world.Class I Class of gas giant, larger than Class J, and smaller than Class S and T.Class J and T Class J and Class T planets are gas giants. Class J are smaller than Class T which are considered &quot;super&quot;, or &quot;ultra&quot;, gas giants. In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode &quot;Starship Down&quot;, the USS Defiant enters the atmosphere of a Class J gas giant to rescue the crew of a Karemman ship attacked by the Jem'Hadar. The USS Voyager encounters a Class T Super-Giant in the Delta Quadrant with &quot;radiogenic&quot; rings in the Voyager episode &quot;Good Shepherd&quot;.Class K Class K planets are barren worlds with no native life. However, through terraforming, they can be made into Class M worlds. In the original Star Trek series episode &quot;I, Mudd&quot;, the planet Mudd was designated in dialogue as Class K.Class L Class L planets are barely habitable worlds with primitive ecosystems. In &quot;The Chase&quot;, the planet Indri VIII is indicated in dialogue as Class L. In &quot;The 37s&quot;, the planet on which Amelia Earhart and others are stranded is a Class L planet with an oxygen–argon atmosphere. In &quot;Muse&quot;, the planet on which B'Elanna Torres' shuttle crash lands is described as a Class L planet, which also supports Bronze Age humanoid life. In &quot;Timeless&quot;, the USS Voyager' crashes into a Class L planet with an arctic climate. In &quot;The Ascent&quot;, Quark and Odo crash-land on a desolate Class L planet.Class N Class N planets have a reducing environment and are barren and rocky with extremely high surface temperatures caused by thick atmospheres containing carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfides. In &quot;Night Terrors&quot;, Class N environments were mentioned as the ideal places to use oxidizer-free explosives. The Tholian are said to have come from an N Class planet in the Star Trek: The Lost Era book The Sundred. The game Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity mentions that Class N planets are more related to Class M with the key difference being a higher ratio of water to land.Class O and P Planets covered almost completely with water (class O), or water–ice (Class P).Class Q Planets with continually changing environments caused by peculiar orbits, an orbit around a variable output star, or some other factor which causes conditions to drastically change over time.Class R A rogue planetary body, which is one that does not orbit a star but drifts freely in space. However, not all rogue planets are classified as Class R; for instance, in Star Trek: Deep Space 9 episode &quot;The Search&quot;, the Founders homeworld in the Omarion Nebula is referred to as a &quot;rogue&quot; Class M planet. But this is probably a rare situation as most planets that don't belong to a star system would not be able to support life.Class S Class of gas giant smaller than Class T and the next larger size up from Class I.Class T The largest class of gas giant. Smaller gas giants are, in order of decreasing size, Class S, I, and finally J.Class Y Class Y planets are referred to as &quot;Demon&quot; worlds, where surface conditions do not fall into any other recognized category. Such worlds are usually hostile and lethal to humanoid life. If life develops on these worlds they usually take on many bizarre forms, like living crystal or rock, liquid or gaseous physical states, or incorporeal, dimensional, or energy-based states. In the series, examples of Class Y &quot;Demon&quot; planets include Tholia, the &quot;Silver Blood&quot; planet discovered by the USS Voyager in the Delta Quadrant in the episode &quot;Demon&quot; and later mentioned in &quot;Course: Oblivion&quot;, and the home world of the incorporeal Medusans.Class X and Z Reserved for other designations of &quot;demon&quot; planets.</Text>

Synopsis.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The hiss of falling sand. The grit of each particle falling through the neck of the hourglass. He could almost hear it. Aley knew that he would pick the object up when he arrived. He knew its top half would be completely empty of sand, and he knew that his old, gray-skinned master would be fast asleep. The damned codger had always forgotten to turn the hourglass for the next hour. Since practicing the arts, the passage of time was ultimately his greatest curse, but he didn’t let that bother him. He was not worried a bit. A little sip of blood would aid him in that.
On the side of the Road of Rednin, erected alone in the middle of grass pastures, stood his master’s two-story home. It seemed to defy reality— the first floor’s walls were built with individual cobble stones, while the second was hammered up with wood, and the overhanging rooms upstairs were held up by planks stuck to the side. His master, known by the alias Sage, loved the serenity, as anyone close enough to the house would run in the other direction. They knew what it stood for, and more importantly, what it was made for. A last reminder of Spirit hunting’s dominance in the past centuries over Altreya. Sage always kept his secrets close to his chest.
Aley climbed up the stone stairs and cracked the door open in routine. No one worried about theft, so it was left unlocked. Right away, he was hit with a rotten stench. His stomach curling in protest, he slammed the door. His master, as he already knew, slumbered on the dining table, drool soaked up through the mahogany. The hourglass, as he also knew, was emptied. He groaned, slamming the elk skull down onto the wooden surface, items wobbling from impact. The old man gasped, his head jolting back, clutching onto a pouch of powdered steel.
Snorting after spotting the young man, the disgruntled Sage threw the pouch on the crowded table. “What is all the ruckus for, dammit? Don’t you have any decency?”
“Good morning to you too,” Aley moved towards the door again, removing his suit, which he hung on a hook. “You forgot to turn the hourglass again.”
Sage wiped his mouth of saliva, “I… was busy. I keep telling you that.”
“Sure.” Aley could feel the muscles in his back tightening. Dragging his feet to a table at the back, the stench grew. His nose, sensitive as a wolf, absorbed every foul tinge. Glossing over it, flies crowded over a rotting chunk of venison, a dagger stabbed into the meat. Aley pinched his nose, his eyes watering. “What the hell is this, you old codger? Now you leaving dead meat out?”
“Leave it there. It’s for an experiment. I can sense Spirit roaming around in there. I can feel it.”
Aley shook his head, lifting the board the meat rested on. “You appear more senile every day, I tell you. I’m throwing it out.” He headed towards the nearest window, cracking it open enough, the flies trailing along.
“No, no, don’t do that!”
The young man threw the meat, board included, through the slit in the window, snapping it closed in relief.
Sage rubbed his crinkled forehead, more wrinkles marking it every day, whispering insults to himself. “Asshole,” he muttered under cold breath.
“Your distasteful experiments have gotten too far, old man. It’s affecting my sense of smell.”
He chuckled, laughs like crackling paper. “As if your experiments aren’t distasteful either. Last I heard, human murder was on that list.”
Aley hastened his walk, towering over the master. He snatched the hourglass, turning it over. The sand ran through again, falling through the neck. “Do you remember this? I keep reminding you. You need to keep track of time for me. I give you a simple task, and you don’t do it. Turn this over when it runs out. You got it? I won’t know where I am in time without it. It is essential.”
“Yeah, yeah, I got it,” Sage waved his hand in front of his face. “You don’t need to explain it to me. I’ve been a Spirit hunter longer than you’ve been alive, boy.”
“And yet, this hourglass was empty when I got here.”
“I told you. I was busy.” 
Aley scoffed, unlacing the pouch on the table and spilling its contents. 
“Boy, are you ill?! You trying to get us killed?! Steel powder doesn’t grow from trees!” He rummaged around, piling up the dust in haste. “A spoiled child is what you are. Spoiled! What if Scourges come here?”
“I don’t care about Scourges,” Aley leaned over, looming over the master. The old man met his gaze. “I care about how you’re so incompetent at any intellect that you can’t turn an hourglass for me. That’s what I care about. I already feel myself slipping into that void, and you’re over here playing dead… leaking drool all over your table.”
“Then perform Consumption, my boy. Don’t blame me. Get your mind out of that place for a while. You know a little Spirit always helps. That’s what us Spirit hunters do.”
Aley sighed, straightening up. The old man was never fazed when he confronted him. He never mentioned his past to the boy growing up, but he assumed from the place they lived that it was an unpleasant one. Aley, with a careless toss, threw his own pouch in front of the man. “Take it. It’s yours.”
Sage wasted no time to pocket it. Aley, grabbing his elk skull on the way, turned towards the basement stairs. Before his head disappeared under the planks that made the floor, Sage retorted, “And feed your mother, please. She’s been yelping all day. I could barely sleep.” Ignoring the graveled voice, he headed down to the basement.
The basement was no dreamy paradise. Earthy odors of mold and mildew invaded his nose like latching parasites, and a red-fire lantern swayed from the ceiling, flames flickering from fading embers. The floor, matte from piled dust, was cluttered with random items: books, bowls, overturned sacks of wheat, paintings rich with vibrancy. His clothes hung on handmade hooks hammered into a wood veneer. He would wash them in the nearby river, in which he carried an extra bucket back to wash his mother. She laid in the corner, chin on the stone foundation, as her sight wondered in different places. This time, with her eyes, she followed some flies from the venison that stumbled their way into the basement.
Aley pulled off his undershirt, scars abundant all over his ghost-pale skin. They almost throbbed, some dark from age and others bright red. He threw it onto the ground and crouched down in front of his mother. Every day, she seemed to be evolving. Over time, feathered wings extended their way out of her back. She was covered in fur now, brown and course. Her snake-slit eyes appeared more yellow, more reptilian. And her antlers, once dull, branched out to sharp points, intricate and arching.
“How are you doing, Mother?” he breathed, his voice low and quiet. “Did Sage treat you well while I was gone?” Her eyes caught Aley. In that instant, her tail wagged, lifting herself off the floor and brushing her shoulders onto his legs. He stood to greet her.
“Yes, yes, it’s me,” he smiled. “Calm down. I just saw you yesterday.” Not minding anything he said, she stood on her hind legs, dragging a talon through his fine hair. Then, she inspected her son, poking a fresh scar on his cheek. Flinching, he reassured her, “Be careful with that, Mother. I’m okay. I promise I’m okay.” Almost rolling those bright eyes, she wandered into the middle, sitting down as Aley prepared himself. A whine tore through his ears. She was more desperate than ever. “I didn’t forget about your food. Relax. I’ll get to you in a second.”
Standing in front of a table, he pulled a furled poster out from his pocket, rolling it out to see the face of Tristan Bellinger. His stomach turned, harder this time. The face almost identical to reality, he had buried the man under the lush leaves of the Wyth Forest. For Altreyans, the forest was darkness. For him, it was solace. And for the ones who met their untimely end to Elkskull, it was a graveyard. Keeping his own alias at the back of his mind, he lifted a rock pinning down a stack of similar posters, the poster inserted in the random pile. He felt the glass vials jingle in his other pocket. His mother’s ears had perked up at that.
“Alright,” he sighed, pulling the vials out. There were three, in fact. He laid two on the table. “This one is for you.” Unstoppering it, he kicked a metal bowl towards her, pouring the fresh blood into it. With no hesitation, Mother began licking at it, emitting a feral hum.
It was his turn. The stopper pulled off, he stared at the blood through his dark spectacles. Fresh. Pure. He forced the whole thing down, every drop of blood sliding down his throat. A spike of adrenaline flowed through his body, his fingers spasming. The memories of Tristan all flooded him. He closed his eyes, facing them. Tristan was only a child when he saw his fallen father dead, corpse hauled on a stained tumbril. Later, the man strummed a lute’s strings for the first time. He saw Tristan’s retirement and dozens of bottles lined up on window sills. He saw the man’s marriage, when he forced a jade bracelet onto Hayra’s wrist. Who could not forget the face of Altreya’s darling? He saw the birth of his first son, and then his second, and then the group of Spirit conservationists that he worked with. He saw Tristan’s sons growing into young boys, and he saw the violent fights between him and his wife. And finally, Aley saw his own face. The Elkskull. The final memory.
Forcing it all down, time began to seal its cracks. Perception of time felt normal, for once. Flashing images withheld themselves, and Aley could breathe alone now. Live in the present. That was a blessing, but it came at a cost. In what seemed like forever since he felt time’s aching hand properly, everything began to hurt. Everything became tiring. He dragged his way to a corner in the basement, where he curled up onto the cold floor. His mother, finished with her meal, curled up right next to him, her eyes succumbing to the ties of sleep. He hoped that he could sleep well tonight. It was his only wish. Even though he endured an unending responsibility that weighed on his shoulders, aware of his father’s judgmental stare from the Domain, he wished he could escape reality at least tonight.

            <Notes>He goes back home, the home of his Master. He feeds himself and his mother as his Master talks to him about his goals.

The Master tells him about the man he’s paid for information— Hathes the Mercenary. Hathes would not tell him the name of the man who claims to know about Spirit revival, but Aley goes to investigate.

Puts the poster down on the table once he gets home. On a pile with a bunch of missing posters, like a collection. But he doesn’t care about them.

            <Title>19 -  Describe negative biases</Title>
            <Notes>
Go back to your character sheet and look at all the aspects of the characters you've listed so far. Get a piece of scratch paper and start writing down all the negative prejudices each aspect of this character might face. I highly recommend separating them into economic, biological, social, professional, etc. Then go into your culture section and, in a whole separate section from your previous categories (which are most likely all to be related to Things People Do), write about a page on each overall prejudice grouping on that list. Double check against your diversity entry in your culture section, and if you don't already have a representative of most of the main categories, you might want to add a line or three about the negative views of other people on the categories not represented by your characters. Just because you don't have catmen as main heroes or villains in your work doesn't mean someone won't start bitching about how filthy and savage they are, even as an aside.Some of these will overlap from character to character, i.e. unless you have a two-person cast with one man and one woman, your women and your men will share the potentiality of being treated as their gender rather than as a whole and individual person. Likewise you might have three scientists in your work, and so they might face the same outside perception as being snobby and intellectual. Thus, rather than separate it by character, clump them all into groupings and organize your thoughts into a paragraph for your culture section.Keep in mind that these are external perceptions, not descriptions of what these people or practitioners of certain skills actually do or are like. Also, some stereotypes and opinions might only be held by one group within that same category against the other, i.e. literary authors prejudiced against genre authors. Crips against Bloods, etc.Also remember that these are all negative perceptions, and treat them as such.

            <Notes>
Flipping through your character sheets, outlines, and notes, what are the most developed factions in your work? Either in terms of how vivid they are in your head or in terms of how prominent they are in the outline. Go back to your Settings section and pick up their pages.Starting with the ones that are least vivid but most prominent in your outline, if such a thing exists, write five or so sentences describing the history of these factions. How they were founded, who has historically been a member if the membership has changed, what was the original goal and how that goal has changed, how long ago they were founded, etcetera. Go back to the root questions of Who, What, When, Where, How, and Why if you're stuck for details. Try not to overlap too much with the motivations, you already have that information down. You might also, if the inspiration strikes, list notable people who are members and a phrase on why this person is notable.

            <Title>21 - Develop your factions. What are their motivations?</Title>
            <Notes>
Look at your character notes and your outline. By now you should have enough structure in it that you can pick out everyone's goals, both for the main individuals and for various groups in the story. Every person or group of persons who drives the plot should have a discernible goal or motivation. Even some of the groups or individuals who don't drive the plot but provide background color or red herrings might have a discernible goal or motivation. Note that when I say &quot;discernible&quot; I mean that you should know what it is and be able to tell or remember from your notes. You won't need to spell out everything in your story text itself. In fact, if you have a clear idea of your characters' motivations and you've written well enough, your audience should be able to determine the overall shape of your character's motivations by their actions and words, without you needing to state it clearly.For now, we'll break it into two parts. At this stage all we need to do is name the factions, the individuals or groups of characters, or even groups acting within your work as a single entity. Organizing them by general goal sometimes makes it easier to draw lines and collect people together under a single umbrella entity, but you don't necessarily have to.On a piece of paper under &quot;Settings&quot; (a new category!) write down the names of each of these groups. It can be a single name of a company or organization or it can be a descriptive phrase, such as Evil Bastards With Scythes And No Sense. Write down the names of all the characters in each faction, whether they're proper names or just descriptive. Write down a brief two to three sentence summary of the group, its goals, its resources, and its public presence (if it has one).At this point you can do one of two things, depending on what you feel capable of handling. You can either expand your factions to fill in some gaps, flesh out the world, or muddy the waters of your central conflict or you can leave it as is.

            <Title>44 - Systems of government/bureaucracy</Title>
            <Synopsis>Systems of government (if the scope is big enough) or local bureaucracy (if the scope is smaller)</Synopsis>
            <Notes>Only a few major world-building processes left! You can do it! Go back to your scope and look at it, and check it against your outline. We're going to address some more stuff that will (in most cases) remain in the background, but nonetheless will be important in your world.If your scope is large enough, you'll be dealing with one or several nations. Collections of land and people who have agreed to be united by a name, a line on a map, and perhaps most importantly (certainly most relevant to our exercise) a system of rules by which everyone agrees to abide, and a collection of people who draw them up and enforce them. Note that I did not say the collection of people, i.e. the government, is agreed upon by the people who are governed. That's not always the case.Have a look at your scope, your outline, and your geography. How many countries will you need to make up? Have a look at all your materials, which is why we save this one for last, and see what you've built up around the story you want to tell. Are there a lot of characters with professions in caregiving or teaching? Are there a lot of soldiers? Is this a well organized land or a land in chaos with everything falling apart? A lot of these things have already been decided, when you were deciding what normal life experiences were and how difficult it was for your protagonists (or antagonists) to obtain some things. Re-read these notes and see what they point to, and then answer the following questions in a page or so of description:What services are provided by the government? What taxes, tolls, and fees are exacted? How much control does the government have over the population, and how much does the population have over the government? How is it structured to perpetuate itself? To limit itself? How does the population see the government, and how aware are they that different forms of government exist? How aware are they of how the government functions, and what its role is and restrictions are according to the existing laws? What questions haven't you answered that you should be asking? Because I know I haven't covered them all here.You'll need to do this for every nation you have. You may do this for all the nations you have ideas for, but the point of making this geared towards the outline is that you don't do more work than you need to for the purposes of your work. Splashing around in the creative pools of world-building is for after. It might also help to familiarize or re-familiarize yourselves with the general types of government: republic, democracy, aristocracy, etc. Communism, the social contract. Most of these are short reading. And a tour of most wiki sites on dictators should, if you can stomach it, give you a brief overview of how such governments are run. </Notes>

            <Title>33 - List the influences on your character</Title>
            <Notes>On a piece of scratch paper, go through your character section for each character and list off every person, place, or event that had a strong influence on your main characters both protagonist and antagonist. You might even want to separate them that way, as persons, places, or events. This will require a lot of cross-checking all over the place, so definitely use scratch paper. With each influence, add in a couple of sentences explaining how and why.When you're done with this you'll need to do two things, not necessarily in this order. You'll need to summarize these influences on your character in a brief biography. Make it about a page or two, and start from the earliest point in your character's history you can think of, tracing the events in his or her life from inception to the start of the novel. Remember to add in details like where they learned their profession, when they picked up their hobbies, when they met their friends. Mark off notes in your timeline when specific events happened in your character's past, and this will also help you refresh on what kind of events your character might have been reacting to.The second thing you'll need to do is go back over these persons and places and shuffle them into your character and setting sections, respectively, if they're not already in there. Flesh out each person influence with at a minimum a seven or so sentence paragraph on how they have interacted with the character you were working on. You can also go back and do most to all of the character exercises in this Leviathan. Then do the same for the places. You might want to locate them on the map or they might already be there, in which case you might want to add in a few more lines of description. </Notes>

            <Notes>That was potentially a long exercise, now we'll have a short one, and a fun one I hope. Descriptions! Start with the places and people you're working with in your outline and scribble down in the margins, on a sheet of scratch paper, or on a sticky note, one sentence of description for each of the five senses. As many of them as you can, at least, most characters aren't going to go around licking things. I hope. If you have time and inclination after that, go through and add these descriptions to other places, other characters. Add taste or smell or sound memories to the rites of passage and typical experiences you worked on earlier. Flesh out your world, make it vivid, not just in the organizational or grand details, but in the little things, too. What does it smell like? How do the buildings feel to the touch? </Notes>

            <Notes>
As with before, you need to take a look at how many people you'll be showing your reader, and adjust proportionally. Go back to your outline and scribble in the margins the number of people who have speaking roles in each scene. If you're not down to scene by scene yet, ballpark it.Diversity means a lot of different things. There's racial diversity, gender diversity, and ability diversity, just to start with the things that can be easily seen. There's also sexual orientation, social or economic class, religion, and so on and so forth. Pick five points of diversity to consider when making the demographics of your characters, and group all the speaking parts into those categories. Try to make these points of diversity relevant to your outline, although some of it will be background information that's never outright stated in the text. Be sure to consider that some categories will have a 'null' field, for example, if a person doesn't own a home or reside in any one place and therefore cannot be a resident of District anything.Make categories for each of these points of diversity, record three to five sentences describing each one. For example, in this world there are various species of sentient beings, with 'sentient beings' as the overall category. Humans are the dominant category, followed by the fae, Hellhounds, and ghosts. Some other types of creatures such as shades and pixies are of controversial origin, and may be a subspecies of humans or fae, respectively. In X city there are two types of people, the people who live in the city proper, and the people who live in the suburbs but consider themselves as being from the city. In this country the dominant religion is Pastafarianism, but other religions include Discordianism, the Church of the Sub-Genius, and the worshippers of Cthulhu. In this story you have fifty two folk with Stars Upon Thars and thirty-seven plain-bellies.This, too, goes under culture. And if you find that some of your categories aren't relevant to your outline later on in the writing process, feel free to add some. Don't remove any unless it's to change the nature of the category, because that can always serve as fodder for later stories.

Synopsis.</Synopsis>
            <Text>An obsidian necklace hung on his fingertip. Oscillating in the still, polluted air, Niko followed it with his eyes. Hypnotized. He sat beside a child’s cot, waiting, the woman who had tried to kill him fast asleep in between its sheets. He had run back to safety when he heard foreign footsteps in that dark alley, the woman limp in his arms, almost cursing to the Archaic Gods why he had brought an assassin to his own home, where his older wife and child of one year slept. It was too late now. The woman had fell into a stupor, and his wife had sat across him. Smoke billowed from the meerschaum pipe in her mouth, a wolf carved on white clay.
She removed the pipe from her lips and exhaled a cloudy puff of rootweeds into the air. “Let’s get to the issue at hand. What do we do with her?” 
Niko kept his eyes on the necklace, dazed.
“Nikolas. Hey,” she snapped her fingers at him.
His trance gone, he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. It had been a long few hours. “Sorry. What were you saying?”
She sighed, taking another puff from the pipe. “What do we do with her? She cannot stay here. I understand your guilt is killing you, but that won’t do it for me. From what you told me, she tried to kill you, yeah? If I was alone with her, I would have rung her neck out already.”
“Rei, stop. I appreciate your concern, but she isn’t the thing I’m worried about. It’s what she knows.”
“What does she know that could possibly be bigger than your life?”
Niko’s hands always trembled as if an ice-chilled wind ripped through him. The necklace jerked around in his grasp. Looking up at his wife, his eyes full like bearing moons, he muttered, “She knows about my past.”
She froze. She placed her palm on top of the pipe’s bowl, its fire languishing to pure ash. She grabbed the dangling necklace, dropped it onto the floor, and held his hands. They were warm to the touch. “Relax,” she whispered. Taking in some breaths, the shadow of the cot crowded his feet. “Breathe. She doesn’t know anything.”
“How does she know I was a Spirit hunter? I suspect people have been talking. I’m already a Salatharian in a city filled with locals. They know something’s up.”
“You’ve stopped, Niko. You have the paperwork.”
“But Hathes… he knows. What I do with him is close enough to Spirit hunting for the Three to send their people to destroy us. That’s what happened in Huntras. That’s what going to happen here in Altreya.”
“But it won’t. You’re worried sick about a girl who couldn’t even end ya right. If I was really worried about this, I would have taken Ash to Rednin by now.”
“Then, what do we do now?” he stared, almost condemned from her harsh but soft words. She had a sort of ironic presence.
“You get the information you want from her. Quickly. And then, we’ll have to kill her—”
“No,” he interrupted. “Killing is not an option.”
“Yes, it is. It’s either her or this family, Niko. If you can’t get your hands bloody over an assassin, what do you think is going to happen to us?”
He withdrew his hands from her grasp. “You don’t understand. I performed the Bestowal method on her. That is a sacred pact. I removed part of my life for her to live on, and your solution to kill her will quash all of my efforts. No. I will ask the questions, but I will not kill her.”
“What will you do with her, then?”
Her red locks glistened in the morning light. She had that beautiful hair and the eyes of a warrior. Determined. Bending over on his chair to grab the necklace, the obsidian still intact, he knew what he would have to do.  He thought of the last time he held it. He sighed once again, “We’ll give her over to Hathes the Mercenary. No exceptions. After that, she’s his to deal with.”</Text>

            <Title>15 - Repeat steps 7, 13, and 14 until done</Title>
            <Notes>
Remember when I said we would come back to step 7 if we had to? Now's the time. If you're working on a single-city or single and small-country scale, congratulations! You get a breather. If you're working on a multiple city, multiple country, or multiple-planet scale, congratulations! You get to do steps 7, 13, and 14 all over again.One of the reasons this is a world-building Leviathan is because it is designed and intended to build off a skeletal structure, your outline, and create system on top of system that supports itself, your world descriptions. And that means digging into a whole lot of things that might never see the light of day in the final draft. Particularly if you're working on a planetary or galactic, epic kind of scale, you will run into the convention that everything must be described in vast and expansive detail. Think of this as filling in the detail beforehand, and doing it in such a way that it's consistent all the way through. Because of the tendency of sentient beings to behave in patterns and develop cultures in patterns, a lot of this will seem repetitive. It doesn't have to be. This is also a good place to compare your different cities or your different socio-economic strata and put in little quirks or vivid details so that when you finally sit down to write, it's less repetitive or monotonous to start with. Or at least less onerous.You also might find it helps, if you're dealing with an epic scale work, to keep each planet or city or country or some other group, separate within your resources section. That's entirely up to you.

            <Title>22 - Develop geography. Consider your outline and where your story will be showcasing</Title>
            <Notes>
Go back to your outline and your scope description. For this, you'll need at least a blank sheet of paper; at most you might want a CAD program like Campaign Cartographer. We're going to be making a map.Start with your origin point in the first scene. Keeping in mind the scope of your work, sketch out the next few locations with respect to the first location. If you're writing a trek across the known world, this might turn out to be a series of the first few towns or landmarks. If all the action is taking place in a city, it might be a handful of businesses within a few blocks of each other. Your map will not be a specific predictable size, and it doesn't need to be to scale. As long as you have the relative positions of every location to all the others, and a scribbled-down idea of the distance, you'll be all right.Now go back to your outline and your character sheets. Both of these will provide secondary locations for you to map out, in references to places and the distance between where the characters are and where these places are. You might also come up with a name that is totally that town over there, or the perfect name for this blues bar, or whatever, go ahead and stick that in there! Eventually in your work you'll find you have a character who's rattling off names of places to have dinner, and that's when things like this will come in handy.All of this comes under &quot;Settings.&quot; If you're using a CAD program, make some printouts. If you're just sketching it out (and don't forget to include distances or a scale bar at the very least!) you might want to make some copies or scan it in so you have it backed up somewhere. You might also find it helpful to copy and laminate, or blow up and laminate, another copy if you're one of those people who uses whiteboards or corkboards to plan things.

Synopsis.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Before the incident, four tasks were completed. They could not be failed.
One. The father skinned the head of the elk, cleaning the flesh and blood off the bone until there was only skull left. He placed it on the ground with the utmost respect, two other elk skulls joining it as if they were the corners of a triangle. 
Two. He removed the cork from the vial and poured the blood into a white basin. Together, the concoction glowed blue. Spirit was strong here. The collection of blood was gathered from an assortment of animals, but it didn’t matter to him. It was no coincidence that Spirit was most abundant in the veins, carried through the blood, which happened to be the life essence of all beings. If you did not bleed, you never lived. And even the Archaic Gods bled.
Three. Fren and his son Aley carried her coffin to the living room, lowering the box onto the floor. In front of it laid the hearth. A script engraved on the top read, “Until we meet again.” Aley, excited as ever, followed Fren’s instructions. His father had been talking about the possibility of this event for months, but they had finally obtained enough life essence to try. If he had taught Aley anything, it was to always try.
Four. Fren placed the basin on the coffin, wetting his hands with pure Spirit. He looked at his son, a shaky breath replacing his once confident one. “B— back up, my son. It’s time. It’s time for her to come home.” The boy did as he was told, and Fren focused back on the basin. It had been a while since he had tried any spells, but he had to do it today. He had to be stoic. Silent. Unbothered. With his hands, he traced the written script in blood, every stroke precise and every gesture coordinated. He did not lift a finger until the symbol was perfectly drawn. He was a different kind of painter.
“Love,” a woman’s voice called to him. “Look what I painted today.”
A young Fren peeked across her shoulder. Sat on a stool, in the very same house, was a slim woman. She gestured at an easel, bright sunlight illuminating the canvas. A spectrum of colors swirled around a painted face. It was her self-portrait. 
“Wow, that is beautiful. Where did you get all that talent?”
“Oh, stop it,” she whispered, half-blushing. “I’m not even done.” She painted a few more strokes.
“I think it looks great the way it is. You shouldn’t keep changing it.”
“I’m not,” she smiled. “I’m only adding a few extra touches, that’s all.” She painted a bit more. “You know what’s a good idea?”
“Yeah?”
“Surprising you with the painting all finished.”
He chuckled, confused. “What?”
“Can you turn around?”
He stared, bewildered. “But I’m already here.”
“Come on! Turn around, silly. Live a little bit. I want to surprise you.” Laughing, she tried to spin him around with one hand. He laughed too in response.
“Alright, alright. Look. I’m turning. You’re really insistent.” Dawdling, he spun around to please her. He didn’t know how long it would take. Time always treated him wrong, minutes weighed like hours. This time, however, it didn’t take long. Strange.
Finally, she spoke. “Okay, I’m ready. I’m so excited for you to see what I worked so hard on. Go ahead. Turn around now.”
Fren played along, turning towards her again. “Alright, now let’s see what you—“
The painting was different. No swirling pallet of colors surrounded her face. Instead, it was surrounded with voided black. And where her eyes were… emanated a bright red, dripping down her cheeks onto the edges of the canvas. Blade slashes were abundant around the neck. Her skin a pale gray, as if aged. Pulpy, decaying flesh.
“Darling, what is this?”
“It’s me,” she said.
“I don’t understand. What did you do to the painting?”
“I didn’t do anything. I painted myself exactly as I look. You know why?”
He could not rip his eyes from the canvas. “What? Why?”
“Because I’m dead.”
Fren woke with rabid eyes, body jolting from the cot. The pelt he used at night, once a bear, was thrown to the ground. The memories of them together flooded his mind. Weakened his resolve. It had been many years since she passed, but it all felt like hours… as if she was already behind that bedroom door.
Pound.
His muscles tautened at the sudden rapping.
Pound.
Pound. Pound Pound. The rattling of wood. Aley, sleeping in a separate cot, was startled out of his dreams. They both stared horrified but excited about what was behind the door. Were these sounds of success? Fren signaled the already-rehearsed routine with a gesture, and the boy responded by grabbing his silver sword, a pouch stuffed with steel powder, and a small dagger he tucked inside a belt loop. Confident, Fren crept towards the living room, where the racket grew with intensity. Aley followed suit, as his father turned the knob and pulled the door away to see if it had worked.
The coffin shook. The pounding grew louder. Scratching could be heard from the sides of the box, and the script flickered bits of blue light from Spirit, while the elk skulls had turned to dust. 
“Get to the other side, Aley!” he yelled. The boy, of course, obeyed. Fren stood at the ready, watching his life’s work culminating to this moment. This would be his masterpiece.
The coffin stilled. Everything had quietened down. The script’s glowing light faded, and everything seemed perfect. Too perfect.
He held his hand out in panic. “The axe. Bring me the axe.” Fren was brought the axe and, with poor patience, chopped the chain off that binded the closed lid. He grasped at the edges, signaling for Aley to help. They both began to pry open the coffin box, anticipating for his wife and the mother of his son to be held inside. Alive. That would be truly perfect.
“One… two… three!” 
They lifted the lid up. Threw it to the side. The surface of the deadwood walls covered in dust, Fren and Aley gaped at the real fate that awaited them. Under meshes of cobwebs and specks of debris, a creature was curled up on the bottom. Guttural growls shuddered the box. Course hairs grew out of its pale, gray skin, a tangle of brown and discolored patches of fur dotting its gaunt figure. What once were nails had transformed into talons, and snake slit eyes watched the shadows that played off the now-illuminated interior. Dull antlers, shorter than finger length, stuck out of its skull. It darted its eyes around, following the ever-changing shadows from the swaying hearth. Maybe the concoction of blood was too much.
“Dad…?” Aley did not blink as he inspected his mother. It didn’t look anything like her. “Is that…?”
“Don’t talk.” Aghast, Fren placed a hand over his mouth, his breath even shakier than before. Limbs had reattached in awkward angles, and skin appeared too stretched on her body. It didn’t make sense at all. Like cluttered patchwork. There was a reason no one imbued corpses with life essence. Once life was taken, it couldn’t be given back easily. He knew this in the back of his mind, but it nevertheless slipped by him. Fren’s hand shook as it reached out to his son. A shiver caught his arm and infected his skin with goosebumps as he inched towards the silver sword that Aley held. “Give me the sword.”
“What?”
 Fren’s voice shook, “Don’t argue and give me the sword.”
Aley shifted his focus on what he assumed was his reborn mother, the creature counting the shadows on the walls. He shifted it back to his father, who had carefully grabbed hold on his sword’s handle. The disgusted face Fren displayed. It all pieced together. The boy pulled away, Fren’s grasp lost in the wind. “No.”
“Give it.”
“Why? What are you going to do?”
Eyes like fogged mirrors, blinded by regretful waters. The man did not look at his son. Only the creature who he once thought could be his wife. He muttered under his breath, “Please. Give me it. You’ve never disobeyed me. Trust me, Aley. I seem to have made a mistake.”
“No, you didn’t. You brought back Mother, as you said. She’s right there! You did it.”
“That’s not Mother. That thing is not your mother.”
“That thing?”
“I should have stopped playing with Spirit when I had the chance. If she could only see how foolish I am now. Give me your sword, son.”
Everything was too much for a young boy. Aley felt the power that he held in his hand. The power of choice. However, Fren was getting impatient. He stepped closer towards him, keeping strict eye contact on the creature.
“N— no. No.” The boy backed up.
Fren turned his head to Aley, his mouth half-agape. “What did you just say?”
“I— I said no. I know what you’re going to do.” The boy backed up a bit more. “You’re gonna hurt Mother.”
Fren sighed, sauntering towards Aley. “Boy.” Aley kept falling back, pushing against the wall. “Who said I would do such a thing?”
“Stay away. You will not hurt Mother.”
“Try to understand that—”
Aley aimed the sword at his father. Fren stopped, the sharp tip of the sword pointed at his neck. The boy cried. Had he gone too far this time? 
“You can’t hurt Mother!”
A fear overcame his voice, “Okay. Okay. Relax. Let’s start with putting the sword down, Aley. How about we start there? I’m not going to hurt her.” He stepped closer, but his son was persistent. He could not move further without nicking an artery. “I’m your father. Trust me. Let go of the sword.”
The boy’s hands trembled, the silver sword less than an inch away from his father’s neck. “Don’t hurt Mother… I won’t let you. You can’t bring her back just to take her away again… you can’t.” 
In less time than he could afford, Fren skirted to the side of the blade, grabbing hold of Aley’s wrists with a tight grip, the sword clattering from the loss of leverage. He yanked the boy to his face, spit spraying. “Are you kidding me?! Are you trying to kill me?! What is wrong with you, boy?”
“I’m so sorry! I’m so so sorry!”
“You stupid child! How dare you point a weapon at your own father? When I give you orders, you follow ‘em, dammit! Don’t act like a hero where you’re not one!” Fren acquired the fallen sword, absorbing the feel of its familiar grip. Engraved on the blade were miniature scripts, meaning words ancient to Fren’s mind. His past felt foreign, disconnected. His arms dangled, numbed… he stood there contemplating. Aley cowered under his looming shadow. “Do you know how many mistakes I’ve made in my life? Do you know what a poor mind poisoned with hope feels like? No. You don’t. You’re only a child, unable to understand anything by yourself unless I show you the ropes. No. You see that there? That is not your mother. I’ve finally sobered up. No, that is the result of my curse, to play the dreaded role of the Gods. And I played that role when she had you, when you were only a pup and could barely breathe, but now, with the most displeasure I’ve ever felt in my life, I regret to say that I have to play it again.” Twisting the handle, he turned towards the coffin. “It’s my orders for you to stay down, boy. It’s for the best. I need to fix this.”
“No!” Aley screamed. Jumping on top of his father, he pulled him down with all the force a small boy could muster. He scraped wool until it reached skin, where his fingernails latched onto layers of flesh. Fren yelled, prying the little fingers embedded into his shoulders off until Aley collapsed onto the ground. The thump cracked the wood below.
Fren stood at the ready. Left foot forwards, right foot backwards. Aimed at his wife. Focusing his aura on the sword, the scripts engraved on the silver glowing blue, he tilted the blade and was ready to dash. Aley, in haste, recalled the dagger he had in his possession. With shaky precision, he aimed it at his father, hoping it would do something to stop him. He threw it hard. The dagger whistling through the air. It struck him in the calf. His focus interrupted, he knelt down in pain, checking what had hit him. The blade stuck out of his leg. 
He turned around. Rage ignited his resolve. “You goddamn runt!”
He stood at the ready once more. Aimed at his son this time. Pure adrenaline pumped through his eyes. Eyes as snake-like as his own wife’s. Spirit ran deep through his veins, bringing the animal out of him, his spiritual aura vibrant and possessed. Veins glowed light blue, tiny sparks under the skin shooting up his arms. Nothing went through his mind, only feral rage that few had seen in his lifetime. Lunging at Aley, the sword barely reached his own child’s flesh when a figure tackled Fren across the room in the blink of an eye.
Mother, the creature spawned from death, stiffened her fingers and slashed the man back and forth in strokes with her black talons, full force tearing away at flesh and bone. As if she was an eagle, she screeched, muscles in her back flexing. Fren shrieked, brown wood painted with streaks of red. Writhing, trying to push her away for some relief, she tore at everything in her way, arms and veins tattered. 
“Evalyn!” Fren cried out. “Please, spare me!”
Aley ran to the slaughter, screaming, “Stop! Please stop! You’re hurting him!”
She uttered a few strained words, slurred with savage intent. He kicked around, dealing blows to her legs, but she barely moved. She pierced the sides of his body to grab hold, like a starving bird of prey. Mother flailed him around, banging his head onto the hardwood floor, over and over. Pound. Pound. Pound. His mind went fuzzy.
The boy cried, “Stop!”
Pound. “Please stop! It’s all my fault! I—” 
A last bang echoed, a crack following suit, and Fren went still. Blood pooled in the spaces between the floorboards, his skull cracked open in the back. One eye rolled backwards, the other staring at his wife. His spiritual aura dissipated, as if the glow was his body’s final attempt at clinging to life. This was the fate of most Spirit hunters— to burn bright and die young. But he could have been much more. So… much more.
Aley, paralyzed at the reality of the situation, buckled at the weight of what had happened and stumbled to the ground. Incredulous. Broken. He couldn’t look at his father. The guilt was too much. Evalyn removed her nails and threw him over to the side. Inspecting the blood that oozed from his sides and the stained red that glossed over the talons, she groveled to her son. Through little disconnected moments of time, letting her son process everything, he finally faced her. Her face docile and loving. She seemed to be the same as he remembered under all of the fur and animalistic tendencies. 
With a gulp, Aley spoke to her for the first time, a bead of sweat sliding off his forehead…
 “…Mom?” 
Evalyn stretched her arm out, her index finger reaching him. He flinched, seeing the dried blood settling on the black nail. He whispered in a low tone, “Father… no.”
With the back side, however, she caressed his cheek, a low purr-like sound emerging after every breath. His eyes teary, the animal had disappeared from his vision, and his mother shined through. Memories from when he was younger flooded his mind. He gave in to the touch, remembering all the moments when his own mother comforted him. And now, after so many years of her gone, she had come back in his father’s place. But he couldn’t ignore the carnage under his nose.
He sighed, his eyes widening. “He really did it.”
The both of them absorbed the silence, but they could not remain unbothered for long. The stench of death had lingered for too long, and the feeling of loss, dormant from his mother’s passing, had come back. Nothing was easy, and rarely was it understandable. That was the philosophy of every Spirit hunter— those who craved the act of playing God. And Aley had just seen it for the first time.</Text>

            <Title>14 - Describe the technology for each socio-economic class</Title>
            <Notes>
Staying in your resources section, add a new paragraph about about the technology available. This technology might be as basic as the wheel and the simple machines, to iPods and netbooks, to as complex as small spacecraft and food replicators. If you're stuck for ideas, build off the lifestyle and expectations. Go back to the outline and see what this character would need to accomplish the things that character accomplishes. Do those things needed fit within the character's socio-economic class? Are they outside of it? If so, what is within the socially expected boundaries of that socio-economic class?Keep in mind also that &quot;technology&quot; is here used very, very loosely. A peasant in a hut with access to a spinning wheel and a loom has weaving technology, it's just that the technology isn't what we think of in terms of it doesn't involve electricity and things going beep. More specific than 'resources' but less specific than &quot;communications devices&quot; or &quot;entertainment,&quot; consider it &quot;things with moving parts that can break and need to be replaced.&quot; Very nearly every socio-economic level has them. Shoes have moving parts that can break and need to be replaced. It's just a question of what, what parts, and how easily can it be done.

            <Notes>You have where your character is now, and it's time to organize this a little better and figure out where your character came from. Go through all the information and straighten it out into a timeline. You can either rewrite your original information so that everything is laid out in chronological order or create a separate document for the timeline.Once you have all the backgrounds for your main characters, use the very rough progression of a life in this world you're building to create a series of three or four templates for what is the standard of normality. These templates don't have to be of a specific person with a name and a family history, more like a series of experiences, rites of passage, and expectations of a person as they age in the society you're creating. There might be greater or fewer of these, depending again on the scope of your novel and how many different societies you'll be dealing with. Your character specific information goes in your character section, but the general information on a more normative childhood goes in culture.</Notes>

            <Title>36 - Develop the normative life experience</Title>
            <Notes>Now flesh out the templates. Give each sentence a paragraph or more worth of description. Start with infancy, how most people are born (in a hospital, in a home, in a convent?), whether or not there is a new birth ceremony such as a baptism or a name-giving, and go on from there. You should continue to have at least three or four templates unless your entire cast list is three or four people long. Even in a single city, different people will have different life experiences and different ideas of what is “normal” for them, depending on race, class, social status, etc.If you're stuck for what kinds of points in a person's life to describe, consider the biological stages of a sentient being's life first. Get back to some very basic basics. For most sentient beings in fiction, whether mainstream or science fiction/fantasy, there are some simple biological steps shared by all sentient beings. Birth followed by a short period of infancy, then childhood for lack of a better but less obscure term. The period between developing basic motor and communication skills and the next stage, puberty and adolescence. The developing of advanced biological functions such as procreation and advanced communication, strategy, and thinking skills. In other words, teenagerhood. Then the body stops growing and for a variable length of time, you have an adult of the species. Then the beginning of the body's decay as processes function less and less well, and then death. And for each of these stages, humans and other sentient life forms generally create rituals or cultural expectations around them, to explain and assist with the transitions between one stage and the next.At the end of this exercise you should have several pages worth of an individual's journey from birth to death, three or four variations. Again, you might have more variations depending on the scope of your work, and you might have fewer. All of this goes in the culture section.</Notes>

            <Notes>
This can be an obvious decision for some novels: mainstream, some mysteries, most crime or pulp novels are overwhelmingly set in a world where magic has no place. Almost all fantasy (now including urban fantasy) novels have magic in some form or another. Still, you should put at least a little thought into whether or not you're going to put magic into your novel, and why. Three to five sentence paragraph, under Summary information. Consider, also, magical realism and the weight some events in your novel might have if you leave it ambiguous as to whether or not it was magic or simply coincidence. This is where your outline comes in handy! You know things like this already, or you know where you need to figure it out.Inevitably, if you do this long enough for enough different worlds, you will come up with a few problems. As with magical realism example, you'll run into the problem of &quot;I want X but not Y.&quot; The easiest thing to do right now is to write that, and then leave several lines and set it aside. Come back to it later. You'll be building up a number of different aspects of the world all at once, they won't all be fully developed one after the other sequentially hitting all the bases A through Z.The second easiest thing is to ask why. Why this and not that? Why one but not the other. Start writing down reasons, and then reasons for those reasons. See what either looks likeliest or what fits together best, what has the most concrete basis. Start with the first things that come to mind first and what seems to follow logically, and then start thinking outside the box. Again, only a handful of lines for this. We'll go back to it later.

            <Title>Spirit Hunting</Title>
            <Text>FAQ:
What is spirit hunting?
Spirit hunting is a sacred art in which an individual manipulates the life essence, known as Spirit, of biological things. 
What is Spirit?
Spirit is the primordial substance that the Archaic Gods synthesized to mold life. In every living being, Spirit flows through the body by blood. The three places where Spirit is most abundant is in the veins, the heart, and the brain.
What is the Godline?
Every human comes from a maternal and paternal line going back millennia. The Godline is the paternal tree that goes back to one of the Archaic Gods, Harren. There are only males in the Godline. Men that come from the Godline can see the Spirit that flows in every being as bright as light. Thus, society created special spectacles that give normal vision to those from the Godline in order for them to experience regular lives, made from Scourge ash.
Who is Harren?
 Harren is one of the Archaic Gods. He is known for being the only God that lived and procreated with humans. He wanted to live a life as one of his creations, so he imbued Spirit into himself in order to live and die.
What are the three basic cornerstones of spirit hunting?
They are Consumption, Fortification, and Bestowal.
What is the difference between the Passive and Active?
The Passive is the being that is receiving the treatment from one of the main methods of spirit hunting, while the Active is the being that is actively performing the method.
What is Consumption?
Consumption is a method in spirit hunting in which the Active extracts Spirit from the Passive for themselves. The main way to consume Spirit is to drink blood, which is why it’s considered the most barbaric method in spirit hunting. Not only that, but consuming foreign Spirit can cause deadly diseases, so it’s not used very often except for the criminal side of this sacred art. This method was mostly found out through studies on Scourges (they feed on high Spirit beings)
Can any being consume any other Spirit? (Example is a human consuming bird Spirit)
No. The Active has to consume Spirit from the same species as itself; otherwise, it suffers from a gruesome death as the body adapts and begins to transform into the species it consumed. This breaks homeostasis, and therefore death occurs.
What is Fortification?
Fortification is a method in spirit hunting in which a being burns its own Spirit to gain supernatural features, thus being both the Passive and Active at the same time. These features include more endurance, speed, strength, agility, resistance, tougher skin, and enhances all senses. While burning, Spirit rises to the surface of the skin, the eyes and veins of the being gaining a visible light blue shimmer. However, there are major limitations. Burning Spirit means killing off the life essence in the being’s body. Therefore, since there is a limited amount of Spirit in every being, life expectancy is dramatically decreased even with the slowest Fortification performed. Beings can even kill themselves through too much Fortification or too many instances of the method in their lifetime. As Spirit rises, the more Spirit is burned in Fortification, the more the being takes on a feral, wild persona, where all thoughts fade and the animal instincts of hunger and blood thirst persist. The effects of Fortification lasts as long as the targeted Spirit is completely used up and burnt. The dead Spirit roaming in your system is expelled through the mouth or the rectum afterwards.
What is Bestowal?
Bestowal is a method in spirit hunting in which the Active “gifts” the Passive by bestowing them with Spirit. This is the newest method invented, even though it is still ancient, and it is performed by writing a script onto the Passive with the blood of the Active. The script, glowing blue, immediately begins to extract Spirit from the Active through the skin and float towards the script as wisps, which it absorbs. When the Active is done with the method, they rub the script off and the rest of the floating Spirit in the air returns to the Active’s body. While this is viewed as the sanest and less sinful method in the arts, there is still a lot of public disdain due to the reign of The Three’s Spirit conservation movement. There is also a huge limitation. Since the Active is losing Spirit, their body begins to age and rot if enough is gifted, starting at the extremities like the toes and fingers. This is the reason a lot of Spirit hunters who perform the Bestowal method often hide their aged hands with gloves.
What is a script?
A script is a symbol used by many Spirit hunters. The Script Lexicon, invented by Archmage Sev and his sect, was created as a way to amplify the manipulation of Spirit, which led to the creation of the Bestowal method and the use of spiritual rituals.
			

Limitations:
As your body gets older, it’s harder for it to accept foreign Spirit. That’s why people don’t live forever. By the age of 105, most humans reject all foreign Spirit.</Text>

            <Text>Niko is a police officer that hunts down Spirit Hunters


Niko is summoned to the Ten, where the council give him the task to teach their spirit hunters how to revive the dead in order to have a significant advantage in war. He is one of the only known Spirit Hunters that know how to do it. The others are already dead. Most of the were eaten by their own creations. He doesn’t want to do it as it goes against his morals, but he is forced to once his family is in danger. He has already worked with the government, and it sent him down a dark path.
Niko talks to his wife, where they both decide it’s best for them to run. They pack and run off in the middle of the night. Niko guides them into a forest where he places a beacon that wards off Scourges from the site. He goes into the city of Altreya to pick up resources.
He sees a dead child in the street, ripped of clothing and money. He follows some guards, which are trying to put out a fire. A young man is sitting in front of the house with a creature next to him. Niko immediately notices that creature was created through the spell. He approaches and talks with him.
Niko buys the young man, known now as Aley, something to drink and pays for lodging. Niko asks him about the creature, and after seeing a vision in time, knowing he has to tell him for some reason, Aley tells him that the creature with him is his mother, created by his Spirit Hunter father. After telling Niko his father’s name, Niko is struck with fear and runs away. We do not know yet that Niko and Fren were part of a group that discovered the spell to return life essence to the dead as a government experiment. Aley smells the scent of the family he had just slaughtered.
Niko returns to the forest with the supplies. He finds his wife and child dead, their necks slit. Even though his heart hurts and he cannot fathom their deaths, he buries them in the forest. With all the regret he has, knowing that he doesn’t have a desire to live, he decides he wants to write down the ritual for the forbidden spell and kill himself.

            <Title>18 -  Develop the culture around these various activities</Title>
            <Notes>
Go back to your Culture section, and have a look at the categories you've created. Then have a look at your list of skillsets. With a little luck and maybe a little fudging, almost all skillsets should also fit into a 'culture' sub-section. You might have to add one or two, depending on how specific you went initially.Under each sub-section, for each skillset, write a three to five sentence paragraph describing it in the progression from novice to mastery. Add another couple of sentences describing the social weight, positive or negative, attached to the skill grouping. Finally, determine how common or rare the skillset is. For example:Culture --&gt; Crafts --&gt; Pottery. Here goes a description of the progression of a potter, from where they might take classes and learn the skill to what they might be able to do once they master the skill. Followed by a couple of sentences describing what people in the setting or settings would think of a potter. Followed by how common skilled potters are in this world.Culture --&gt; Sports --&gt; Pod racer. Here goes a description of the progression of a pod racer, from how one learns to drive a pod to what the life of a famous pod racer might be like. Followed by a couple of sentences describing how they're viewed by the public, followed by how common skilled racers are.Culture --&gt; Finance --&gt; Corporate lawyer. You get the picture.If you find yourself coming up with other skillsets, or something that just doesn't fit, by all means, add it in as well. Keep in mind that we're looking at culture in an anthropological sense, which is commonly and originally defined as what people do in a society. This involves knowledge, beliefs, customs, habits, laws, practices, rituals, expectations, hobbies, products, foods, transactions... many, many things. If you're not doing it for your immediate survival (eating because you're hungry, sleeping because you're tired) chances are it has some culture attached to it. Right now we're just taking skill groupings and describing them in the context of a larger culture because it's easier to approach describing it piece by piece.

            <Title>13 - Describe the economic and related social classes</Title>
            <Notes>
Check your resources section for economic classes you've outlined. You should have a designation such as &quot;upper/middle/lower&quot; or &quot;working/ business/leisure&quot;, or you might have made up words in your first economics exercise. Whatever terms you use you should have a less-to-more scale of economic classes as you flip through the resources section of your binder. Take a pile of scratch paper and copy over each class or designation or term onto its own paper, because you'll be doing a lot of scribbling before this gets organized.Find the occupations or other source of income for character in each class, and sort them. Use that as a jumping off point to jot down five or six other vocations in each economic class. These jobs might never appear in your work, but it gives you a more rounded idea of the sort of people who enjoy that level of economic wealth. Include volunteer or part-time positions if you want. For example, a person considered middle class in this world might work as a drop-ship maintenance engineer, a teacher at a government funded school, or a lab technician. Volunteers at the soup kitchen in this district of the city tend to be of this economic class, whereas clinic doctors tend to be of this other economic class.This would be easier if we had transparencies that we could overlap, but since we can't we'll make do. Look at your list of occupations, vocations, and professions, then consider how many social classes there are in your nascent world. Go back to your binder and below each paragraph detailing the resources available in each economic class, write another 3-7 sentences paragraph describing who the people in these economic classes are and what they do.Remember that while economic classes are more or less rigidly defined by earning power, cost of living, and other concrete factors, social class is more fudgable. Someone with title or an old family name might be very poor and trade on the sympathy of their title or name, while someone who is wealthy but has only been wealthy for a generation or less might have a different set of manners than otherwise. Add a third paragraph, 3-7 sentences, describing the hobbies, lifestyle, mannerisms, and noteworthy details about the lifestyle of each group. In other words, put the socio- onto socio-economic class.
